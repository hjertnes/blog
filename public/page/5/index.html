		<h1><a href="https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-02-21-bye/">Taking a break from Micro.blog</a></h1>
		<h2>21.02.2020 18:56</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Recent happenings here at Micro.blog have gotten me to taking a break from Micro.blog. It might be a short term or I might never come back. I have added all the RSS feeds of the people I followed to my RSS reader, and if you want to talk I&rsquo;m always available on <a href="https://keybase.io/hjertnes">https://keybase.io/hjertnes</a>. I&rsquo;m not removing my site from Micro.blog for now, but I might do that in the future.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>The reason I am leaving is that I believe Micro.blog has the oposite problem of Twitter. A lot of the time when someone are critical, negative or harsh people start to criticize it. Or sending me links to the community guidelines, even though what I said could not in any resonable proper interpretation be i violation of.</p>
<p>At the current state I don&rsquo;t feel like I can be myself here. It seems to me that the only style of writing that is okay here at the moment is what I would describe as &ldquo;lunch at gradma&rdquo; or &ldquo;christian youth club&rdquo;. It is sad, because I do enjoy a lot of the people on here.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

			<p>I have moved my wiki off from hugo to being one large HTML document instead. My friend <a href="https://micro.blog/eli">@eli</a> first did it, and I decided to do the same myself. The reason is that I write my wiki as a large org file, and this kind of output reflects what I see it as</p>

		<h1><a href="https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-02-07-fucking-atp/">Notes after listening to ATP 364</a></h1>
		<h2>07.02.2020 13:44</h2>
		<div>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to any tech podcasts anymore, because they bore me to death. The closest is probably Go time, a podcast about the Go Programming Language. But @eli talked about how dumb the hosts were being so I decided to listen and post my reactions to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh my fucking god. So much talk about all kinds of bullshit&hellip;</li>
<li>SwiftUI</li>
<li>Who the fuck writes a view that is hundred or hundreds of lines.
<ul>
<li>Clean code and Single Responsibility FTW</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weird stuff is hard with declarative models because declarative programming tries to force you to not doing weird stuff, and weird stuff is almost always a bad idea.</li>
<li>Declarative programming is hard, but not impossible.</li>
<li>There is plenty of good examples of good patterns to follow if you look at for example react.</li>
<li>Even though three gumpy old rich white men don&rsquo;t think so, there are clean ways to use it</li>
<li>I think John is the only one who gets it</li>
<li>Marco struggles with anything new, as always. He is like a cobol programmer</li>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>Marco is all wrong.</li>
<li>Homebrew works well most of the time, and things rarely break as long as you keep things up to date. It might be broken for a few days here and there. But I almost never experience it, and I upgrade my system multiple times a week.</li>
<li>John builds from source, and that is the most John thing ever. HA</li>
</ul>

		<div>
			<p>I&rsquo;ll try to do this each week. But it will probably more like most weeks. Just a recep of what I have been doing on my <a href="https://wiki.hjertnes.blog">wiki</a>. Last week I worked a lot of the template to make it show everything more likea a outline inside of a large cloud of entries and tags. And I also updated most of the pages in it. Plus that I re-organized everything into a intial structure.</p>
<p>This week I have added a reviews section and posted five new drafts I had ready to it.</p>
