      <description>My main focus of late have been my wiki and mastodon over the last year or so.
But as 2020 are concluding I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what I&amp;rsquo;d like to change next year. One of them is that I&amp;rsquo;ll start blogging more again.
I also made some traditional Norwegian christmas stuff for the first time yesterday:
Might also start participating the micro.blog community again. Haven&amp;rsquo;t made up my mind on that.</description>

      <description>Just pushed an update to my wiki. I have written a lot of new stuff, and updated most notes in some way. And I have also fixed the between notes links. Will probably start moving to a proper changelog next week.</description>

      <description>I brought my wiki back this week. It kind of went offline when I went from roam to org-roam. But this week I found some time to write the stuff needed to generate it.
It is generated with this script. It takes all my org-roam notes that doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain &amp;ldquo;#+private: true&amp;rdquo; and converts them to HTML with pandoc. And then this go program makes the index page.
None of it is fast, but it works.</description>

      <description>I have my last day as a developer for Sbanken on Monday, and I&amp;rsquo;ll have 2ish of vacation, before I join Knowit Experience as a Senior Developer in the start of November.
I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this for many reasons. Two of them are:
 I&amp;rsquo;ll be using a Mac at work again. After two years of Windows, I can say that everything I hated about it in 2004, is still more or less the same And I&amp;rsquo;ll be working from the city center.</description>

      <description>I have updated the design today. Stole some stuff from Eli and made it my own.
My wiki is down at the moment. Or not down, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot there. The reason is that I had that thing, and then I migrated it to https://roamresearch.com/ and then that became https://orgroam.com/ and I have no working way to publish that in a good way. So my wiki is just for me at the moment.</description>

      <description>Not a lot of content changes this week, but I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to use Roam as my wiki. Currently I have a private and public one. All the editing and writing is done in the private one. And then I export it. remove the stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be public and import it into the public one.
The process isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I&amp;rsquo;d like, at the moment. So I will probably not update it every week.</description>

      <description>I have been working on some changes on my wiki this weekend:
 Some mayor changes in the structure; there will be more soon ish. Moved back to using hugo and ox-hugo to generate it. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with the result. I think a lot of what I loved about the former format have been maintained, while not all the issues I had with the first attempt at building a wiki with ox-hugo.</description>

      <description>Changes on my wiki since the last time I wrote one of these.
 Yesterday I migrated from GitHub to Sourcehut. This have been a very long and slow process for me. On one side I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to because I think GitHub is great. On the other I felt like I had to because of their relationship to ICE. Part of the problem is also that the service I use to build and serve my websites(https://netlify.</description>

      <description>My wiki have been my main website for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of migrating the content of this blog over to it. I just removed all the &amp;ldquo;status&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;micro blog&amp;rdquo; posts. The next steps would be to go over everything and re-write it as something on my wiki for everything in the archive. It won&amp;rsquo;t be a simple move but a longer process and probably many re-organizations in the process.</description>

      <description>Not a lot of new stuff this week, but I have worked on some stuff this week.
 The org file my wiki was generated from is now included, will soon add a link to it and the github project A links section. The idea is to add links I use all the time to this one A Journal section. The idea is to add some limited in scope or time &amp;ldquo;blog like&amp;rdquo; series of texts here.</description>

      <description>Most of my focus at the moment are going into my wiki, but because I don&amp;rsquo;t have or want a RSS feed there, I&amp;rsquo;ll write every week or every two weeks here about the changes I have done there.
 I took all my blog post drafts I had and added them to the wiki Did some simple re-organisation. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do more of it next week. Went through everything and updated it And I&amp;rsquo;m also playing around with the non stable version of Emacs again, the upcoming version 27.</description>

      <description>Recent happenings here at Micro.blog have gotten me to taking a break from Micro.blog. It might be a short term or I might never come back. I have added all the RSS feeds of the people I followed to my RSS reader, and if you want to talk I&amp;rsquo;m always available on https://keybase.io/hjertnes. I&amp;rsquo;m not removing my site from Micro.blog for now, but I might do that in the future.</description>

      <description>I have moved my wiki off from hugo to being one large HTML document instead. My friend @eli first did it, and I decided to do the same myself. The reason is that I write my wiki as a large org file, and this kind of output reflects what I see it as</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to any tech podcasts anymore, because they bore me to death. The closest is probably Go time, a podcast about the Go Programming Language. But @eli talked about how dumb the hosts were being so I decided to listen and post my reactions to it.
 Oh my fucking god. So much talk about all kinds of bullshit&amp;hellip; SwiftUI Who the fuck writes a view that is hundred or hundreds of lines.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do this each week. But it will probably more like most weeks. Just a recep of what I have been doing on my wiki. Last week I worked a lot of the template to make it show everything more likea a outline inside of a large cloud of entries and tags. And I also updated most of the pages in it. Plus that I re-organized everything into a intial structure.</description>
