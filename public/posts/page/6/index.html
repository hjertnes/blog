<li>A links section. The idea is to add links I use all the time to this one</li>
<li>A Journal section. The idea is to add some limited in scope or time &ldquo;blog like&rdquo; series of texts here. Currently only one on how I think about making this wiki</li>
<li>Added a &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; timestamp to everything. Set to today.</li>
<li>Updated my comics list</li>
<li>Some small re-org of the emacs section</li>

		<h1><a href="https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-02-23-update/">Updates in the last two weeks</a></h1>
		<h2>23.02.2020 09:07</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Most of my focus at the moment are going into my wiki, but because I don&rsquo;t have or want a RSS feed there, I&rsquo;ll write every week or every two weeks here about the changes I have done there.</p>
<ul>
<li>I took all my blog post drafts I had and added them to the wiki</li>
<li>Did some simple re-organisation. I&rsquo;ll probably do more of it next week.</li>
<li>Went through everything and updated it</li>
<li>And I&rsquo;m also playing around with the non stable version of Emacs again, the upcoming version 27. It has native support for JSX and tabs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other big thing I have been doing this week is to take a break from Micro.blog, like I wrote about on Friday. I appriciate how supportive a lot of people were about why I chose to do that. I&rsquo;m currently checking out <a href="https://dog.estate/@hjertnes">Mastodon</a>.</p>

		<h1><a href="https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-02-21-bye/">Taking a break from Micro.blog</a></h1>
		<h2>21.02.2020 18:56</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Recent happenings here at Micro.blog have gotten me to taking a break from Micro.blog. It might be a short term or I might never come back. I have added all the RSS feeds of the people I followed to my RSS reader, and if you want to talk I&rsquo;m always available on <a href="https://keybase.io/hjertnes">https://keybase.io/hjertnes</a>. I&rsquo;m not removing my site from Micro.blog for now, but I might do that in the future.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>The reason I am leaving is that I believe Micro.blog has the oposite problem of Twitter. A lot of the time when someone are critical, negative or harsh people start to criticize it. Or sending me links to the community guidelines, even though what I said could not in any resonable proper interpretation be i violation of.</p>
<p>At the current state I don&rsquo;t feel like I can be myself here. It seems to me that the only style of writing that is okay here at the moment is what I would describe as &ldquo;lunch at gradma&rdquo; or &ldquo;christian youth club&rdquo;. It is sad, because I do enjoy a lot of the people on here.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

		<div>
			<p>I have moved my wiki off from hugo to being one large HTML document instead. My friend <a href="https://micro.blog/eli">@eli</a> first did it, and I decided to do the same myself. The reason is that I write my wiki as a large org file, and this kind of output reflects what I see it as</p>

		<h1><a href="https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-02-07-fucking-atp/">Notes after listening to ATP 364</a></h1>
		<h2>07.02.2020 13:44</h2>
		<div>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to any tech podcasts anymore, because they bore me to death. The closest is probably Go time, a podcast about the Go Programming Language. But @eli talked about how dumb the hosts were being so I decided to listen and post my reactions to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh my fucking god. So much talk about all kinds of bullshit&hellip;</li>
<li>SwiftUI</li>
<li>Who the fuck writes a view that is hundred or hundreds of lines.
<ul>
<li>Clean code and Single Responsibility FTW</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weird stuff is hard with declarative models because declarative programming tries to force you to not doing weird stuff, and weird stuff is almost always a bad idea.</li>
<li>Declarative programming is hard, but not impossible.</li>
<li>There is plenty of good examples of good patterns to follow if you look at for example react.</li>
<li>Even though three gumpy old rich white men don&rsquo;t think so, there are clean ways to use it</li>
<li>I think John is the only one who gets it</li>
<li>Marco struggles with anything new, as always. He is like a cobol programmer</li>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>Marco is all wrong.</li>
<li>Homebrew works well most of the time, and things rarely break as long as you keep things up to date. It might be broken for a few days here and there. But I almost never experience it, and I upgrade my system multiple times a week.</li>
<li>John builds from source, and that is the most John thing ever. HA</li>
</ul>
