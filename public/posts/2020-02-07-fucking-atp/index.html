				<p>I don&rsquo;t listen to any tech podcasts anymore, because they bore me to death. The closest is probably Go time, a podcast about the Go Programming Language. But @eli talked about how dumb the hosts were being so I decided to listen and post my reactions to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh my fucking god. So much talk about all kinds of bullshit&hellip;</li>
<li>SwiftUI</li>
<li>Who the fuck writes a view that is hundred or hundreds of lines.
<ul>
<li>Clean code and Single Responsibility FTW</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weird stuff is hard with declarative models because declarative programming tries to force you to not doing weird stuff, and weird stuff is almost always a bad idea.</li>
<li>Declarative programming is hard, but not impossible.</li>
<li>There is plenty of good examples of good patterns to follow if you look at for example react.</li>
<li>Even though three gumpy old rich white men don&rsquo;t think so, there are clean ways to use it</li>
<li>I think John is the only one who gets it</li>
<li>Marco struggles with anything new, as always. He is like a cobol programmer</li>
<li>Homebrew</li>
<li>Marco is all wrong.</li>
<li>Homebrew works well most of the time, and things rarely break as long as you keep things up to date. It might be broken for a few days here and there. But I almost never experience it, and I upgrade my system multiple times a week.</li>
<li>John builds from source, and that is the most John thing ever. HA</li>
</ul>
