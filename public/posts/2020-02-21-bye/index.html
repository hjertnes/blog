				<p>Recent happenings here at Micro.blog have gotten me to taking a break from Micro.blog. It might be a short term or I might never come back. I have added all the RSS feeds of the people I followed to my RSS reader, and if you want to talk I&rsquo;m always available on <a href="https://keybase.io/hjertnes">https://keybase.io/hjertnes</a>. I&rsquo;m not removing my site from Micro.blog for now, but I might do that in the future.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>The reason I am leaving is that I believe Micro.blog has the oposite problem of Twitter. A lot of the time when someone are critical, negative or harsh people start to criticize it. Or sending me links to the community guidelines, even though what I said could not in any resonable proper interpretation be i violation of.</p>
<p>At the current state I don&rsquo;t feel like I can be myself here. It seems to me that the only style of writing that is okay here at the moment is what I would describe as &ldquo;lunch at gradma&rdquo; or &ldquo;christian youth club&rdquo;. It is sad, because I do enjoy a lot of the people on here.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
