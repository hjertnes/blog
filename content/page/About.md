# About

I'm Eivind, and this is my personal website and blog. You'll also find all my social media stuff here. It is syndicated to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/hjertnes), check it out if you're into a social media thing that is based on blogs. It feels a lot more like how Twitter was in the old days. I also have a pen and paper blog at [The Ink Smudge](https://inksmudge.net).

I live at Stanghelle, right outside Bergen, Norway with my dogs and fianc√®.


I currently work as a web developer, mostly using JavaScriot, React and C#; in the past I have done a lot of PHP and Python. These days I mostly do LISP and Clojure for fun. And in the past I have also worked in IT and fundraising.
