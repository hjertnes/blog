# Uses

This page is a short summary of all the important stuff I use. The idea is that I only mention the stuff I would miss if I lost it(or stopped working for the software stuff).



## Hardware



  * MacBook Pro 2016, without TouchBar; 16GB of RAM; 512 GB SSD. Space gray. _I hate how unreliable the keyboard is, and it drives me nuts that it lacks a SD slot, other than that a pretty great machine. I do almost everything on this or my ThinkPad_

  * iPhone 8 Plus; 64 GB; Space Grey, with a red Apple Silicone Case. _I went with this one instead of a X because I didn&#8217;t have the time to wait for it. There is not much to say about it, except for that it is like the 6s and 7 a improve ment of the predesessor. Everything is like you except them to be, and everything works like you expect._

  * Two pairs of Apple Magic Keyboard / Magic Trackpad. One at my office and one at my home office. _The trackpad and keyboard combo is great; probably not the best. But it works much better than the built in keyboard on my MacBook. I have one of them in a canopy for if I need to bring it everywhere._

  * Two LG 27&#8243; 4K USB-C Screens; one at home and one at work. _The screen is great, but not fantastic. It looks great and screen over USB-C is great. Charging and screen connection over the same cable is my favourite part, except for the resolution. The software / firmware built into the screen is not the best. But it is honestly the best screen available until Apple gets back into the screen game._

  * Nikon FM analog film camera; with a 50mm Series 8 F/1.8 and a 24mm F/2.8; I usually shoot black and white Ilford films. _I love this camera, nothing fancy, just the basics. Easy to use and reliable. Love the 50mm, but I think the 24 is a little bit heavy. But I love it for when I need a wide angle lens._

  * Fujifilm X-Pro 2. 8mm f/2.8, 35mm f/2, 50mm f/2. I shoot raw. I use 16GB cards at home and 64GB cards when I travel. _My favorite digital camera this far. Having physical dials for the basics (like my FM) is awesome. And makes it much easier to use it. This is the first time I&#8217;m not looking for other cameras, because I have the best digital range finder on the market._

  * Nokia Smart Scale. _I bought the most expensive one, because the difference was not that big. It was a pain in the ass to set up with multiple users. But when it works it works perfectly. Step on it and it shows up in the correct users profile._

  * Apple Watch Series 1, space grey, red sports band. _It have become a little bit slow. But I still love it. 99% of what I use it for is fitness tracking and notifications, and it&#8217;s perfect for that._ 

  * ThinkPad x230, 6GB RAM, 64GB disk, Arch Linux running i3; previously used XMonad. _I love this little machine. I often call it for my iPad with useful software (emacs) or my Emacs Typewriter. I mostly just use it to browser and type into emacs, and it&#8217;s great for that. The keyboard is freaking awesome._

  * Plustek Opticfilm 8100. _This is a dedicated scanner for film and slides. I use it to scan my 35mm film, when I have gotten them developed. I wish the process wasn&#8217;t as time consuming, but this scanner makes it a little bit better, compared to a flat bed._

  * Some Canon flatbed scanner. _I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s called or anything like that. It was cheap, and it is only useful for document scanning. I got it because I had to scan some document to get into the University of Bergen, but didn&#8217;t want to walk through to the other side of the city to scan them. So I bought the first scanner I could find._ 



## Bags



  * [Tom Bihn â€“ Pilot][1]. _The bag I use every single day. It&#8217;s great, like every Tom Bhin product. It has enough room for my laptop, some kables, a few notebooks, some pens and a camera. But not enough room for bringing too much._



## Coffee



  * V60 for pour over coffee. _This is my go to brewing method these days. Simple, easy to use._

  * Aeropress for Espresso like drinks _My go to if I want to use a little bit more time, and want a espresso like drinkj_

  * Bialetti for Espresso like drinks _My favourite if, I want an espresso like drink. Easy to use, but a bitch to clean._

  * Contigo To go coffee mug. _Great mug, but I wish it didn&#8217;t hold the heat as well._



## Pen and paper stuff



  * Lamy 2000 Medium Nib _Great pen, with a lot of ink capacity. My first fancy pen_

  * Pilot Vanishing Point Broad Nib _Good pen, a highly constrained pen, but what makes it great is that it is reliable and retractable. But you should only get one if you need a pen that don&#8217;t require uncapping_

  * Pilot Metal Falcon Broad flex nib. _My favourite pen at the moment. Use a lot of ink. Fun to write and draw with, because of the flex nib_

  * Travelers Notebook with lined refills _Great notebook system that can become exactly what you need_

  * Leuchtturm1917 A5 Bullet Journal \* My favourite notebook for keeping track of notes and stuff to do.\**

  * Nock.co Hightower _Great pen case, fits three pens and a few Field Notes sized notebooks_

  * Nock.co &#8220;field notes sized&#8221; notebooks. _Love them, dot grid, like Field Notes with good paper_



If you were wondering, I left inks out on purpose.



## Services



  * Dropbox. _Dropbox is not great, but the solution for syncing stuff between computers that are the least horrible_

  * Github. _Awesome Git hosting_

  * Linode virtual servers. _Great host, no bull shit, not fancy, but they do exactly what it says on the tin_

  * Slack. _Sigh. Their apps are shit, but the rest is fine. I just wish they made it easier to manage many teams_

  * 1Password. _The best password management solution I know about. Both from a security and UX stand point. Awesome for solo and team use_

  * Wakatime. _Awesome service to monitor how much time you spend in your text editors and give you stats per language, project, editor etc._

  * Pinboard.in _The best bookmarking servie ever, I use it for bookmarks and for read-it-later stuff._



## Social Stuff



  * Micro.blog. _Micro.blog is the only social network stuff I&#8217;m doing at the moment. It feel a lot like twitter in the good old days. And it is powered by blogs instead of a centralized system._



## Blogging



  * Hugo

  * FeedPress. _A great service if you want feed stats or want to keep the same feed url no matter if you change CMS or not._

  * MarsEdit. _The best blogging app on OS X._



## Coding (apps)



  * Emacs(spacemacs). _My go to text editor at the time, it&#8217;s powerful, I use it for almost everything; including reading email._

  * iTerm 2 _Like terminal.app with better UI and some extra functionality, like splitting both directions._

  * Xcode _I don&#8217;t love or even like it, but it&#8217;s the best option for iOS development._

  * ZSH. _My favourite shell, awesome with Oh-my-zsh_

  * git. _SCM. Don&#8217;t love it, but better than the rest_

  * Paw. _Awesome GUI app for OS X for interacting with web api&#8217;s._

  * Homebrew. _The best package manager for OS X_



## Coding (languages and stack)



  * C# / .NET Core. _Great for developing larger stuff, with a strongly typed language. It&#8217;s a lot more like Django or Rails than it used to be_

  * Node / Express. _Express is great for building very small stuff._

  * React / Redux / Webpack _My favourite way to build Web Apps at the moment. It&#8217;s easy to write stuff really fast and it scales to larger projects._

  * Python / Django _My go to for personal projects because you get ORM, Views and Tests out of the box; requires a lot more work to get it working with Node or .NET. Python is also my go to tool for writing command line programs._

  * Scheme / LISP _I love the elegance of LISP, and I try to find more stuff to write in it. Mostly emacs functions these days._

  * Shell Scripting \*I still use some shell scripting, mostly to write easier to use abstractions around complicated commands. \*



## Coding / Server stuff



  * Docker. _Docker is an awesome way to make sure each part of your app is seperate, it makes it easier to manage and you are forced to document and automate it._

  * Nginx _A simple and easy to configure web server that performs very well. It&#8217;s not like Apache, you actually understand every line of the config._

  * PostgreSQL. _My go to SQL server since 2005. As easy to use as MySQL and as powerful as Oracle._

  * Redis _The way to go if you need to cache stuff. It&#8217;s basically a key value store where you can store data that is slow to generate. Awesome for saving JSON outputs that takes a long time to produce_



## Other Mac Apps



  * Alfred. _My go to launcher, more powerful than Spotlight and easier to get into than the others._

  * Arq. _An app to take backups of your computer, but you control where it&#8217;s stored._

  * ReadKit _My OS X feed reader until Brent is done with Evergreen_

  * Karabiner Elements \*The app I use to re-map my CAPS LOCK to shift.\**

  * Amphetamine _A modern version of Caffine. Keeps my Mac from going to sleep_

  * Moom. _My Window manager, I mostly use it to resize windows with keyboard shortcuts._



## Photography



  * Lightroom CC. _I migrated from Lightroom Classic to Lightroom CC at the end of the year. It lacks some features. But with a fast internet connection I think it is faster to get previews from the cloud compared to do it locally. And it&#8217;s nice to have everything in the cloud. And there are settings to make sure you have a local copy of all your raw files on an external drive. Which could make my backup system simpler._

  * Silver Fast. _The scanner software I use to scan negatives. It looks like shit, is a pain in the ass to deal with but the results are awesome._

  * Photos.app. I add JPEG of all my raw files and TIFF scans to Photos. It&#8217;s great to browse photos. 



## iOS Apps



  * Drafts. _Where all of my writing starts on iOS, and I have actions to send it everywhere I need; including scripts to publish to WordPress._

  * DayOne. _Journaling_

  * Pushpin. _Pinboard app for iOS, supports offline reading._

  * Audible. _The best place to find audiobooks._

  * Overcast. _My favourite podcast app on iOS_

  * Spotify. _I have used Spotify since 2009. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I like it more than the others._

  * iBooks. _I use it to read rich content iBooks and PDF&#8217;s and epubs I have from other places._

  * Kindle. _I have a lot of kindle books, not perfect but it works well enough._

  * PinboardAdder. _An app I&#8217;m developing to add bookmarks and &#8220;read later&#8221; stuff to Pinboard. I wrote it to make sure the process of saving them are fast. And then you need to sync them up to the cloud later._

  * Pythonista. _If I need to automate something on iOS I use Pythonista._

  * Prompt. _SSH client for iOS._



## Hippie crap

  * Headspace.  



## Health Apps



  * Activity. _Use it every day to keep track of how active I am._

  * Nokia Health Mate. _Companion app for my smart weight. Not the best app, but I really like how it displays changes in weight and BMI over time._

  * CardioBot. _Use it to get an overview of my heartrate._

  * AutoSleep. _Use it to track my sleep, because, why noot?_

  * Exist. _One of my favourite iOS apps and services. Awesome to connect various data sources and get a combined overview of my life._
