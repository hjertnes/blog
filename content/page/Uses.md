# Uses

This page is a short summary of all the important stuff I use. The idea is that I only mention the stuff I would miss if I lost it(or stopped working for the software stuff).



## Hardware


- MacBook Pro 13" without Touch Bar; the 2016 model, with 16GB of memory and 512 SSD. _Great machine, but I fucking hate the keyboard_
- ThinkPad x230, 12"; 256 SSD and 16GB ram; runs Arch Linux and i3.

- Analog camera: Nikon FM, with a 50mm F1.8

## Services

  * Github. _Awesome Git hosting_
  * Linode virtual servers. _Great host, no bull shit, not fancy, but they do exactly what it says on the tin_
  * 1Password. _The best password management solution I know about. Both from a security and UX stand point. Awesome for solo and team use_
  * Pinboard.in _The best bookmarking servie ever, I use it for bookmarks
  * Instapaper.



## Social Stuff

  * Micro.blog. _Micro.blog is the only social network stuff I&#8217;m doing at the moment. It feel a lot like twitter in the good old days. And it is powered by blogs instead of a centralized system._



## Blogging

  * Hugo
  * FeedPress. _A great service if you want feed stats or want to keep the same feed url no matter if you change CMS or not._


## Coding (apps)



  * Emacs. _My go to text editor at the time, it&#8217;s powerful, I use it for almost everything; including reading email._
  * iTerm 2 _Like terminal.app with better UI and some extra functionality, like splitting both directions._
  * ZSH. _My favourite shell, awesome with Oh-my-zsh_
  * git. _SCM. Don&#8217;t love it, but better than the rest_
  * Paw. _Awesome GUI app for OS X for interacting with web api&#8217;s._
  * Homebrew. _The best package manager for OS X_


## Coding (languages and stack)



  * C# / .NET Core. _Great for developing larger stuff, with a strongly typed language. It&#8217;s a lot more like Django or Rails than it used to be_
  * Node / Express. _Express is great for building very small stuff._
  * React / Redux / Webpack _My favourite way to build Web Apps at the moment. It&#8217;s easy to write stuff really fast and it scales to larger projects._
  * Clojure/ClojureScript: I love how elegant LISPS are, if I do some programming on my spare time it's either Clojure or Emacs LISP
  * Shell Scripting \*I still use some shell scripting, mostly to write easier to use abstractions around complicated commands. \*



## Coding / Server stuff

  * Docker. _Docker is an awesome way to make sure each part of your app is seperate, it makes it easier to manage and you are forced to document and automate it._
  * Nginx _A simple and easy to configure web server that performs very well. It&#8217;s not like Apache, you actually understand every line of the config._
  * PostgreSQL. _My go to SQL server since 2005. As easy to use as MySQL and as powerful as Oracle._
  * Redis _The way to go if you need to cache stuff. It&#8217;s basically a key value store where you can store data that is slow to generate. Awesome for saving JSON outputs that takes a long time to produce_



## Other Mac Apps



  * Alfred. _My go to launcher, more powerful than Spotlight and easier to get into than the others._
  * Arq. _An app to take backups of your computer, but you control where it&#8217;s stored._
  * Reeder _My OS X feed reader until Brent is done with Evergreen_
  * Karabiner Elements \*The app I use to re-map my CAPS LOCK to shift.\**
  * Amphetamine _A modern version of Caffine. Keeps my Mac from going to sleep_
  * Moom. _My Window manager, I mostly use it to resize windows with keyboard shortcuts._



## Photography



  * Lightroom CC. _I migrated from Lightroom Classic to Lightroom CC at the end of the year. It lacks some features. But with a fast internet connection I think it is faster to get previews from the cloud compared to do it locally. And it&#8217;s nice to have everything in the cloud. And there are settings to make sure you have a local copy of all your raw files on an external drive. Which could make my backup system simpler._
  * Silver Fast. _The scanner software I use to scan negatives. It looks like shit, is a pain in the ass to deal with but the results are awesome._
  * Photos.app. I add JPEG of all my raw files and TIFF scans to Photos. It&#8217;s great to browse photos.
