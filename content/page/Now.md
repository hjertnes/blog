# Now


This page is a short summary of what I'm doing now.

- Working as a developer for Sbanken
- Hanging out with my girlfriend Ingri and my dog Luna
- Other than that: taking as many pictures as possible, reading as much as possible, writing as much as possible.
- And I spend too much time messing with my Emacs config and playing with Clojure
