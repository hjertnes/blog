# Now


This page is a short summary of what I&#8217;m doing now.



  * Try to spend as much time as possible with my fianc√® and dogs.

  * CTO at WA.works 

      * Coding, managing our development team and managing our servers

  * Writing 

      * [Hjertnes.social][1] / My [Micro.blog][2] is where all of &#8220;social media&#8221; is these days.

      * I publish twice a week at [Hjertnes.blog][3]

      * I publish once a week at [The Ink Smudge][4]

      * I publish work days at [jstips][5]

      * I try to find as much time as possible for photography. You&#8217;ll probably see me with either my Nikon FM or X-Pro 2 in my hand, when I&#8217;m outside. 

      * And as always: trying to find how to find a good way to use both digital and analog tools.
