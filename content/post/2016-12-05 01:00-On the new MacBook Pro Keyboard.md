title: "On the new MacBook Pro Keyboard"

    The only big struggle I have with this computer is the new keyboards that Apple are going for.

    I have a really hard time to communicate my feelings about it. It is a big change, and I think it might be for the better. But it will take some time to get used to it for many people.

    My favourite thing about Apple laptops during the last 10 years have been that their keyboards have been so good that I never wanted an external keyboard. The strange thing is that this keyboard are still very close to that, except for the arrow keys and a few other minor details. But the key-travel is the thing many people including me are struggling with.

    I thought it was unusable when I first got it. Seriously: I had to type my password 5 times before I got it the first couple of days. But now I type more or less as many typos as I did with my MacBook Air.

    It does require a few days to a week to get used to it. And my impression is that I write much faster on this keyboard than anything else I have used.
