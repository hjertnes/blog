title: "Three of my favourite Clojure methods: assoc-in, get-in, dissoc-in."
---

When people hear Clojure and Immutable, I guess they think with horror of doing that with a language that have not been designed for it, like for example Java or JavaScript. 

In Clojure you use the methods get, dissoc and accoc to get, set or remove values from hashtables or objects if you come from JavaScript land. That's great, but far from revolutionary. Where it really shines is with the get-in, dissoc-in and assoc-in methods. They do the same thing, except that you can go as deep as you need to. They are the best when you work with deep data structures. 

It was when I discovered these methods when I got it. This language is designed to work with immutable types. And it is easier than working with mutable types in most languages.
