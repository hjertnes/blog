**John Siracusa:**



> When I started, I was at the forefront of long-form nerd-centric tech writing. Today, the world has moved on. I might have stopped with my OS X 10.9 review in 2013 if not for my love of round numbers and my expectation that OS X 10.10 would bring a complete interface overhaul that I really wanted to write about. 



It is always strange to see things that have been there for so long, such as Siracusa&#8217;s OS X reviews, go away. I&#8217;m not surpriced. But his review will be missed when Apple releases the next version of OS X.
