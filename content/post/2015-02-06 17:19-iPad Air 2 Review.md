**Federico Viticci:**



> I have a very mobile lifestyle, in the literal sense of the word. My post-treatment physical therapy requires me to move often and avoid sitting for several hours a day whenever possible. And every day, I have to leave my house at least twice to drive around Rome for errands, buy fresh groceries, or just pick up my girlfriend at class. I can&#8217;t afford to sit at a desk for 8 hours and, truth be told, I like the freedom of not being constrained to a desk and use a desktop computer. One of the best takeaways from my journey so far is, without a doubt, a newfound appreciation for movement and the feeling of being free. This, I believe, has deeply changed how I work and slice up work times during the day.

    

> I need and want to be able to work on an iPad. I could use most of my iPad apps on the iPhone, but, even with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, I wouldn&#8217;t have the extra room for content and overall enjoyment granted by a 10-inch display. I&#8217;ve bought five iPads since 20104, and the iPad Air 2 provides the absolute best combination of screen size, comfort, and performance I&#8217;ve seen to date.
