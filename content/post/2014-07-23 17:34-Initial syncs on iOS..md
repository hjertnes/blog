title: "Initial syncs on iOS."
---

I think the initial sync is my main annoyance with iOS these days. It&#8217;s the fact that&#8217;s it&#8217;s such a hassle to do it. I&#8217;m not talking about the apps with a small data set, like for example 1Password; but apps like Spotify and Evernote.



I know there are a lot of both battery, performance and other issues with having something like this. And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a huge issue. It&#8217;s just a pain to do both initial and larger syncs.



The whole process of turning off auto sleep, plugging in, opening for example Evernote and letting it stand there for a few hours while syncing. It&#8217;s not elegant. And even worse, it&#8217;s impossible to explain to non technical people.



You can do better Apple.
