title: "RIP Aperture"
---

The Loop [reported][1] that Apple won&#8217;t do any more development on Aperture. I don&#8217;t think this is a big surprise for anyone. But I think it&#8217;s sad. I used to use the app for a long time; before I switched to Lightroom.



Here is the basic story. I got Aperture when the App Store launched. And then, as time went I got more and more annoyed by the fact that Apple hadn&#8217;t released a major update. So, I bought Lightroom the day they had released two major updates, since the last major Aperture update.



Lightroom is a great app, if you are looking for a Aperture replacement. And you can get a Adobe Creative Cloud subscription with Lightroom and Photoshop for $9 a month.
