A fantastic post about reading and writing.



I often say that reading is good for you. And it is. But you need to read the kind of books that will make you think, and think differently. And you need to take some notes, write down some quotes. A books journal is a great place to start.



And pick up some of the classics, some Plato, some Aristotle, some Descartes, some Nietzsche in other words, the classics. There is a reason people have been reading them for a very long time.
