title: "I don’t know iPad."
---

One of the first things I started looking into when I got my first iPad was how I could use it as my primary computer.



A lot of stuff have happened since that. My primary Mac have moved from a 15” Macbook Pro, to a 13” Macbook Air. And I have three generations of iPad keyboard laying around here; in the same pile as my iPad 2.



Here is the thing, my Macbook Air have more or less the same battery life as an iPad. And the power of OS X and the more or less same weight makes my Macbook Air the perfect iPad.



But. I might consider buying a iPad mini. Yeah, I know; I have been talking about that since Apple released the first iPad mini.



The iPad Air is too close to a Macbook Air; and OS X have so much power compared to iOS. And I don’t need another iPad collecting dust. While an iPad mini would provide some value for me. It looks like a great computer to do some writing on, in the context where I might do some writing, but I don’t wanna wring a bag.



The iPad sales are going down, and some people are saying that the iPad is dead. I don’t believe that. Our current Macbook Air’s and iPad’s are too close to each other. And I think – and hope that iOS 8 will bring something to the table that gives us something that we couldn’t do with a mac.



A reason to buy an iPad Air or iPad mini instead of a Mac.
