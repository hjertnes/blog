    I have been shooting with the X-Pro 2 for a while now, and I think it is the perfect camera for me. But there are of course a few things I wish were different.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    First, I wish the exposure compensation dial had a press to unlock button like the shutter speed.button has, because I adjust it by mistake way too often.

  </p>

    Second, it would have been awesome with a physical dial to adjust the drive mode (single, bracketing, burst etc) to make it faster to change between shooting the different modes. I personally often switch between burst and single.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Third, I wish the menuâ€™s was more like the play / display images function. Never show it in the view finder and always on the screen. Because I always have the screen off unless when I chose to use it, to save battery.
