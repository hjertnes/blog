title: "Definitions" 
---

One of the first things you learn when you start to study philosophy is how difficult it is to write a definition.

Because you want to write a definition in a way where it stands on its own, where you don't need to understand a million other things to get it. While at the same time making sure that you don't include anything you don't want to include and not exlucde anything you don't want to exclude.

This is the reason legal stuff is hard. Laws are just a collection of complicated defintions.

This is why it is hard to write a law, that does exactly what you want it to do in the legal system. It's kind of like programming.
You know what you want it to do, but getting there can be difficult and complicated with a lot of external factors out of your control.
