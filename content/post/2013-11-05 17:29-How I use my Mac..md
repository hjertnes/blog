title: "How I use my Mac."
---

Lex Friedman just had a very interesting [article][1] in Macworld. Talking to various experts(whatever that means), and how they are using their computers. I really enjoy reading about how other people are using their computers, and to learn how to do, what I do better.



I thought I could run through how I use my mac. And the mac I am talking about is a 13&#8243; Macbook Air, the 2013 model, 1.7 Ghz CPU and 8GB of ram. Battery and &#8220;enough&#8221; power to do most tasks is the most important factors for me, since I am around campus and various other places all day. And the newest Macbook Air&#8217;s have all the battery power I need during the day. In other words: I don&#8217;t need to carry a powerbrick.



**My Desktop**, look like this:



There is usually no files on the desktop. Well, that&#8217;s not true. I sometimes place files there, while in the hurry. And end up being there becuase I have not seen my desktop in a few weeks.



The **Dock** is one of the components on OS X that I want to disable. I know why some people us it, but I don&#8217;t. I use [Alfred][2] to launch apps, find files, browse the file system and a lot of other stuff. My dock is hidden, at the bottom and as small as possible. And the only Apps visible there, is the apps I currently have open.



**MenuBar** is either the worlds most useful thing, or that area overfilled with icons that you do not need, use, or know what is. I sometimes use [Bartender][3], if there are a lot of apps in the menubar that I want to get rid off, but I only have it installed when I have to. My general rule is that all the apps in my MenuBar have to be something that I use regulary and that the icon itself serves a purpose.



I will hide any MenuBar icon, if I never use the icon itself for anything. My current menubar icons



  * [Alfred][2]

  * [OmniPresense][4]

  * [Backblaze][5]

  * [1Password mini][6]

  * [Dropbox][7]

  * [Moom][8]

  * [Caffine][9]

  * [DayOne][10]

  * [Unclutter][11]

  * [TextExpander][12]

  * [Fantastical][13]

  * And all the default OS X stuff. 



The funny thing about listing out all of this, is that I see a few things that I want to hide. So this is how my Menubar looks, after doing some Settings and Bartender magic.



There is three times of MenuBar icons, in my humble opinion, the ones you want to see all the time, the ones you want to use sometimes and the ones you just want to hide. Bartender solves this problem.



**Spaces, Mission Control, Full-screen**. Apple fixed a lot of the issues regarding Full screen in the recent Sea Lion release of OS X(I know it&#8217;s called Mavericks, but I think Sea Lion is funnier). I use Full screen, spaces and Misson Control all the time â€“ when I remember that it is there. I cam to OS X during the Panther, but I first started as a full time OS X user during Tiger.



That was before full screen, spaces and all of that. In other words: I often forget that it is there.



**Apps**, no not every single App is use, but more how I manage them, and the windows. I try to always just keep the apps I am using right now running. I&#8217;m weird. But, the reason is very simple: less window clutter, and less tuff to cmd+tab through.



There is not much of a system when it comes to what I am using in full screen, and how I arrange windows. But, I ususally either but it in full screen mode, or use Moom to make the window streach all over the screen.



**Wallpaper**. Some people like to have something fancy as their wallpaper, and some people(like me), just picks a color or the default image and leave it. There is a very simple reason for this: I never see it. There is usually some writing app, some productivity software or a web browser covering it anyway. Why would I pick a picture that I will see for a few minutes during a week when I quit all the apps or need to reboot?



There is a few tricks that I use, like a good launcher(Alfred), Moom to to resize windows and Bartender to hide clutter. But, all the rest is just using the built in tools and minimalism regarding what apps I need to have open.
