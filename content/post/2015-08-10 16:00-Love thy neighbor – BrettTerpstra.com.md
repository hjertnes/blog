> Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy talking to people. I do it a lot. My nightmare (when it comes to living arrangements), though, would be to really like people I have no buffer from. When my friends and I want to hang out, we can flake. We can make lame excuses, or we can just honestly say “I’m not feeling like it.” But if that friend can just come knock on your door, everything falls apart. I love my neighbor for the moron that he is, and appreciate the buffer he provides from the world.
