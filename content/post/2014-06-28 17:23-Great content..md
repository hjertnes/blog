title: "Great content."

I&#8217;m always looking for great new content.



I subscribe to 63 podcasts and somewhere between 40 and 50 sites in FeedWrangler. And I do suspect that I would find more or less the same subscriptions, if I looked at most hard core Apple-geeks podcast or RSS apps.



David Smith had a great [episode][1] of Developing Perspective the other day. Where he talked about a few sites and podcasts that I hadn&#8217;t heard about. Which is great.



There is always room for something great. I would subscribe to all of them if I found a new podcast network with 40 great podcasts that I really liked.



It&#8217;s hard to find great apps, great blogs and great podcasts these days. All of us listen to 5by5 and TWiT. But there have to be more out there.



I wish someone would create something like what [MacStories][2] is for apps, just for podcasts.
