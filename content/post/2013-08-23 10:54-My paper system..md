title: "My paper system."

When you look at any system, I think you will find a few important things about them. &#8211; What is the purpose? &#8211; What parts are in them, and what are they solving? &#8211; What can you change about it to make it more efficient, or better in any other way?



My paper system is very simple, and I always try to keep it as simple as possible; without loosing anything important.



First things first, I try to have a work setup that I can put into one of my computer bags in about two minutes.



Let&#8217;s get back to pen and paper.



**Pens.** I always carry my Pilot Metropolitan and my black Retro 51; and a few refills for both. I prefer writing my a fountain pen, it&#8217;s both about the feel and how my writing looks with it. But, they don&#8217;t work on everything; so I use my Retro 51 on paper that don&#8217;t work with fountain pens.



My Retro 51 is also my go to pen, when I am in class. The reason may be valid, or not; but I will be taking a lot of notes in a short period of time, and I don&#8217;t want to think about if the ink is dry enough when I turn the page.



**Paper.** There is two paper products I always have in my bag; and one that I always carry on my person. They is a large Moleskine notebook, Index Cards; and a Field Notes is always in my back pocket.



They are all different, and serve three very distinct purposes.



_Field Notes_ is a brilliant product. They are cheap, lasts just about long enough â€“ and works great for what they have been designed to do.



The thing I use them for is to just take quick notes when I am not in front of a computer; this is the only place I will write tasks I have to do or ideas.



_Moleskine_. They are not cheap, but I think they are the perfect product if you look at the combination of availability, paper quality and price. The fact that I can walk into any book store or pen and paper shop and get one is the main reason I am using them.



The thing I am using them for is journaling, writing or notes during meeting or classes.



_Index cards_ is one of my favourite &#8220;hack&#8221; items I have picked up from Merlin Mann. I use them for just about anything that I need to be moving around to figure out how to do something.



Everything from brainstorming, to just loose topics that I have to connect together; for example in a argument analysis.



Good luck with your paper system
