title: "Policy and product updates aimed at combating abuse | Twitter Blogs"

> We believe that users must feel safe on Twitter in order to fully express themselves. As our General Counsel Vijaya Gadde explained last week in an opinion piece for the Washington Post, we need to ensure that voices are not silenced because people are afraid to speak up. To that end, we are today announcing our latest product and policy updates that will help us in continuing to develop a platform on which users can safely engage with the world at large. 



Twitter really really really need to get their act together when it comes to harassment. This looks like a step in the right direction.
