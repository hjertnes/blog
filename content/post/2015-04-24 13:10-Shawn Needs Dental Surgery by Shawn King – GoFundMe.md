**Shawn King:**



> The good news is, the dentist didn&#8217;t charge me for the appointment. The bad news is, I have &#8220;advanced periodontal disease&#8221; &#8211; basically, I&#8217;ve lost so much bone in my upper jaw, my teeth don&#8217;t have anything to hold on to. So they will continue to fall out unless I do something about it. 



Shawn is a great podcaster, and he have been doing it for 21 years, long before I knew anything about Apple, and long before anyone knew about iPod, or podcasting.



He needs you help!
