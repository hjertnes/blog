I just read the latest post on Randy Murray&#8217;s site. It&#8217;s called: [Write about your pain][1].



And that made think about that old Hemningway quote, at the top.



The thing I always do, when I&#8217;m depressed and low, is that I open DayOne or a paper notebook, and I start to write about the things that really scares me. Things about your past. Things you can&#8217;t bring up &#8211; ever. In other words: what hurts. Write them down.



Learn to write without filters; it&#8217;s good to get it out. That&#8217;s what a journal is for.



And Subscribe to [Who writes for you][2].



You should also read some Hemningway and Bukowski.
