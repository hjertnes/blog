> We now find ourselves in a world where cameras are becoming ever more capable in a smaller footprint. Apple&#8217;s LinX acquisition is all about multi-aperture cameras, suggesting the desire to fit more power in a smaller form factor using sensors and software to capture multiple images simultaneously. The result is better quality, and more importantly, depth and three-dimensional capabilities. 



This looks interesting, and it might be the next big thing to push phone photography to the next level. But I&#8217;ll probably stick with my huge Canon DSLR.
