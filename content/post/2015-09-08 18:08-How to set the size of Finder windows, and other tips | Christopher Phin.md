title: "How to set the size of Finder windows, and other tips | Christopher Phin"

> To have Finder windows in OS X open at a consistent size and location, open a new Finder window, resize it to how you want, then, and this is the important bit, close it again before you do anything else. Just open the window, resize and reposition it, then close it. Donâ€™t click icons inside it. Now, subsequent new windows will be at the same size and position. 



Great tip.
