title: "The new iPads revisited."
---

I have been listening to podcasts talking about the new iPad for a long time now. And I finally went to my local Apple Authorised Retailer on the way to the university this morning.



There is three things I want from a new iPad, if I&#8217;m going to get one: &#8211; It must be easier to thumb type &#8211; A faster and up to date iOS experience &#8211; Retina screen.



It would also be nice to have an iPad that I could stick in my coat pocket. This kind of excludes the iPad Air.



What I did when I was there was to play with the new iPhone&#8217;s, and the new iPad&#8217;s. I won&#8217;t get a new iPhone now, but I just wanted to see how it was.



The weight and typing experience is two of the key points when it comes to iPads for me. And that was the main thing I did. And I will get to that in a moment.



I never manage to stand there more than a few moments, when I test devices in stores. Because it&#8217;s not how I work. It is the wrong height for a standing desk. I wish they would have some kind of sofa or chair where you could sit and test the products.



The keyboards in both orientations on both devices was amazing. Seriously. Amazing. I was kind of set on getting the iPad mini 32GB with WiFi in January, but I am torn.



What I did when I was there was to write 300 words in both orientations on both devices.



I have kind of big hands, and it is possible for me to thumb type on the iPad 2; is it usable or comfortable? No!



The amazing thing is that this is pretty comfortable on the iPad Air, but not perfect. While this is perfect on the iPad mini, both versions of it.



This was not a big surprise, really â€“ it wasn&#8217;t.



The thing that really surprised me, was how easy it was to &#8220;touch&#8221; type on the iPad mini when placed in a stand in landscape mode.



So, where does this leave me? I don&#8217;t know really.



There is no clear choice this time. Both of the iPads are very light. Both of the are good to type on. The Air is the best when it comes to type on in in landscape, while the Mini is without doubt the best to thumb type on. But, both of them are very good at both.



I think it will be the mini, but I don&#8217;t know. And I have to do some real testing when I can until I can afford to get one.
