IDE's are not my kind of thing, but if it is, then I think [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) is four you. It is a plugin for [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). IntelliJ is without a doubt the best Java IDE I have ever used, and I have spent some time using Cursive, you know, just to give it fair shake, and it is great. 

Some languages need more IDE like features than others. Java and C# are two of them. I'm not 100% convinced that Clojure need all of them though. They might be nice, to you do not need them. Check it out if you are looking for a powerful Clojure IDE, it is the best non-Emacs Clojure experience I have seen.
