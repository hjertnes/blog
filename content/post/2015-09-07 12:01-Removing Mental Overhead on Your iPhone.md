I could not agree more. Doing what Ben Brooks calls the &#8220;CGP Grey&#8221; method, or what I have done on and off for a very long time is great. Some people prefer organizing apps in various folders or app screens. I prefer having the stuff I use all the time on my Homescreen, and having the rest in a folder; and then just search for what I need. The having three icons in the dock and a empty row is weird, but everything feels so much nicer when you do it.
