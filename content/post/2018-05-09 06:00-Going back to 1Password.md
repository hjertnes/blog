title: "Going back to 1Password"
---

I have pass a real shot, because I thought the idea behind it was interesting: a command line program that is a front end to a folder of GPG encrypted files. But I have gone back to 1Password because I felt like it was a little bit too much friction. And my experience is that password manager is an area where you want to workflows to be as easy as possible to make sure that you actually use it. 

The problem with pass was not the app itself, or the iOS app, both of them was good enough. But the browser extensions was very unstable. I'll probably check it out again in the future though. Ô¨Å
