title: "On Plain Text Files versus custom apps."
---

I&#8217;ll be using the term &#8220;plain text files&#8221;, or some variation of it here, but most of what I&#8217;m talking about could also apply to [Evernote][1]; and I will explain it at the end.



There are many apps out there that are good at one single thing. [Quotebook][2] for quotes, [Tapcellar][3] for beer and [Clear][4] for tasks.



But I have been moving most of it out from custom apps, to plain text file lists, stored in my [nvALT][5] [Dropbox][6] folder over the last year; for a number of reasons.



  * Sync. I trust Dropbox, and I know that something need to go really wrong before I lose data; and that is not true for the various iCloud solutions I have used with various other apps. 

  * Backup. All of my plain text files are stored many places: my Mac, all my iOS devices, plus I have various other backups as well, including the systems that backs up my mac. I have full control, something I don&#8217;t have on the more closed down systems, like iCloud.

  * Durability. A plain text file will outlive most of the technology we have today. The text files of the 80s, and probably the 70s going back as far as regular file systems exists still work today<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>. I might not be able to use &#8220;use&#8221; a markdown file in 30 years, but I know I could read the raw file. 

  * Interoperability. I can find something that can deal with my files on any platform: web, OS X, iOS, Windows, Linux etc. 

  * And I can also find a new app to replace an old one, the day the developer stops maintaining it. 

  * Flexible. I can refactor the structure of any of my text files to fit changing needs to do more or less everything(I just need to remember to document how it all works). 



The downside to all of it is of course that you need to do a lot more of the hard work yourself. But I think it is well worth it, in some cases, at least for the stuff I don&#8217;t use that much.



Evernote. You can do more or less the same with Evernote. The sync is solid. The only difference is that there are way less third party clients. But you can trust the sync, even though it is a little bit slow. And alternote is a good option if you don&#8217;t like their OS X client.



The great thing about Evernote is that they have a client for everything, no matter how small(or stupid) the platform is. Do you remember the BlackBerry Tablet? No, of course not. No one does. But they had a app for it.



Text files are a great option. And I find it a lot easier to find stuff inside nvALT, or Editorial on iOS, than looking through various apps.
