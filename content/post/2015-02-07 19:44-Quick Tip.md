**Bradley Chambers, The Sweet Setup:**



> Do you ever look at the free space on your Mac Hard Drive (Click the Apple Logo → About This Mac → Storage) and wonder what is taking up all that space? It happens to me all the time. DaisyDisk is my favorite tool for doing a deep dive into what is on my hard drive. 



DaisyDisk is a great tool, for exactly one job: to figure out where all your disk space have gone.



I first heard about it on [Mac Power Users][1] a very long time ago. And I have used it ever since. It used to be the kind of tool I only needed because of software development. But I think everyone should have it today.



The reason is very simple. Most of us have SSD drives today. And that means: less space. I went from 1TB to 256GB. I used to operate with a buffer that was the same as the available space on my current drive.



Don&#8217;t buy daisy disk today, but wait for the next time you think: where did all my hard drive space go?
