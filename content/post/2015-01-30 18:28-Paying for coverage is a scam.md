**iMore:**



> The answer is: Nothing. We don&#8217;t take a dime to cover any product on iMore. In fact, even the suggestion that we would is horribly insulting to our sense of ethics. Unfortunately, not all web sites are so inclined. 



iMore is a great site, and Peter Cohen&#8217;s NSFW is fantastic. I don&#8217;t get a lot of requests like this, but I have gotten them in the past.



One of the core principles of everything I do is that I would rather not make any money at all, than making it in a scammy or dishonest way. It&#8217;s just wrong for a web site to charge for writing about a product.



Your readers need to trust you; ads or memberships are fine. But you can&#8217;t loose your integrity
