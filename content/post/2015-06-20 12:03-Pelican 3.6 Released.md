title: "Pelican 3.6 Released"

**Macdrifter:**



> You may not know it, but this site runs on little blogging engine named Pelican. I like it. Version 3.6 is out now and has a lot of improvements. I really need to update but that&#8217;s one of the reasons I like Pelican. It just keeps working without messing with it. I would like the article caching but I never care about how long it takes for the site to build. It all happens on the server every 10 minutes. CPUs are cheap. 



I use Jekyll for the same reason.
