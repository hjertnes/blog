[Axios][1] is a awesome HTTP Client for JavaScript that I have used for over two years now. I first discovered it when I was looking for a good and clean Promise based HTTP Client that did just that â€“ HTTP stuff.



Back in the day most of us used jQuery for almost everything. These days I try to avoid adding it to my React based projects.



Axios is very easy to use. You just import it and call axios.get/post/put/delete and you have more advanced options if you need them. I have yet to find something I had to do that can&#8217;t be done with axis.
