title: "Happy Hacking Keyboard 2" 
---
I got my Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2 a few days ago. This are my initial thoughts. There will be a proper review at some point. 

What I was looking for was a better keyboard than the Apple ones I have been using. Ideally one that I could use both at home and with my Windows computer at work. I wanted something small, with a US layout, with good typing experience. With arrow keys, home, end etc. 

As of typing this, I have had it for three days. And I have gotten used to using it for the most part. Getting used to having arrows under a fn key was a lot easier to get get used to than I expected. 

It is great to type one, and it is compact enough to fit in any bag my MacBook fits, while at the same time not feeling like a small keyboard. It looks small, but the keys are not small.
