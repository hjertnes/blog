Facebook released a new app a few days ago. It&#8217;s called [Slingshot][1].



A lot of people around the internet have posted some far from favourable reviews.



I kind of disagree with them.



First of all, the app looks much better than Snapchat. And they avoided to implement the most annoying part of Snapchat, the timer. The fact that you have to send a picture back before being able to view the pictures someone sends you is weird.



But, it&#8217;s a fun app. It&#8217;s more fun than Snapchat. And it might stick.
