title: "OS X Yosemite & Launchers."
---

OS X Yosemite brings some long overdue features to Spotlight. And some people believe this is bad for the companies that are doing launchers. Like Alfred or LaunchBar. I don&#8217;t agree.



First of all. Spotlight will be enough for some people. The people that just want to find apps, files and don&#8217;t need anything except for the built-in searches in the new Spotlight.



But there are a lot of power user features in both LB and Alfred that you don&#8217;t get in spotlight.



I don&#8217;t use LaunchBar. It&#8217;s a great app, but I find Alfred to be a much more configurable and easy to use alternative.



I have been a user of Alfred since before the 1.0. The exact date I started using it is fuzzy, but I think it was early 2010.



Here is the thing about Alfred. You get a great default experience. Everything from ejecting DMG files or drives, to finding files, apps, contacts. You can even control iTunes with it.



But the thing I love about Alfred is that it&#8217;s easy to create new workflows. You can trigger them on files, keywords and hotkeys. I have one to lock the screen. And I have another on to update my jekyll site. Just to mention two of the many workflows I have.



My understanding is that you can use more or less any scripting language to write workflows for Alfred.



And there are a load of existing Alfred workflows available for download around the internet. You should check out [Alfred][1] if you want an easy to use but yet powerful launcher for OS X.
