**Patrick Rhone:**



> Signatures have power. Our laws are only desires until they bear the signature of those that execute them. Signatures have value. Our checks and charges are only valueless scraps of paper unless our signature is applied. Signatures have meaning. They are a promise. They change things. Yet, most of us dash ours off quickly, with little thought or recognition of such. 



I love signatures, and I love how different they are. I see a lot of them in my job(fundraising). Some people have a slow and beautiful signatures where you can read every single letter without any problems, while others, like me just have a scribble, where you can recognize the starting letters of my first and last name.
