title: "The TTY Delystified"
---

**Linus Ã…kesson:**



> The TTY subsystem is central to the design of Linux, and UNIX in general. Unfortunately, its importance is often overlooked, and it is difficult to find good introductory articles about it. I believe that a basic understanding of TTYs in Linux is essential for the developer and the advanced user. 



This is the most interesting technical artical I have read in a very long time. And also for a person that have spent over ten years on Linux and UNIX systems and a huge portion of that time in the terminal. A must read for all the UNIX and Linux geeks out there.
