title: "What is Enough for me?"
---

I just finally finished the [Enough Archive][1] that I have been working on for about a month! or so. And I started to re-listen to the whole thing about a week ago, and started to think. What is the stuff I really need to have there. This is all the apps I need to get my work done in a fashion that don&#8217;t make my life any more difficult than it have to be. I haven&#8217;t included any of the default OS X apps.



**Dropbox** is one of the really essential parts I really really need everywhere. I syncs a lot of my essential data between devices, and it is also my preferred way to share files with others.



**1Password** is my secure locker. It is a password manager, and a lot more. If it is something I would not want anyone else to see â€” then it will end up in 1Password. Everything from passwords to notes about how the computers I have set up for relatives.



**Alfred** is my launcher. I search with it, I start apps. My Macbook Air is more or less broken without it. Or I&#8217;m at least far less productive,



**Text Expander** is a tool for expanding snippets into larger pieces of text. I use it to catch stuff I never manages to spell the right way, or stuff I have to write many times. Great app.



**Fantastical** is the only calendar app I use. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s in my menu bar. It makes it fast to add new events by writing stuff like &#8220;Lunch with Steven tomorrow at noon at The fancy hipster coffee shop&#8221;. It also makes it easy to get an overview over events. I don&#8217;t need or care for a full calendar app.



**Omnifocus** is the app that manages everything. Everything I have done today was there and everything I am going to do tomorrow is there. It is a great GTD app if your really need something powerful.



**Scrivener** is the big boy writing app. I don&#8217;t use it for most blog posts. But I use it for assignments at the university and all other larger writing projects. It is just the kind of crazy tool that makes anything over 1000 words either easier or bearable.



**Byword**is where is do most of my writing, I start blog post ideas there. I am writing this in byword on my iPad right now. I sync it with iCloud between my devices. It&#8217;s great at letting me get started at the writing within seconds, and to get it done



**nvAlt** is the app that keeps track of all my notes. What kind of allergy meds do I use? Who is my doctor? What is the name of all of the books I want to buy one day? All of this is in nvalt. A great app to search, manage, edit and create plain text notes.



**Evernote** is my archive. Everything I&#8217;m done with, and would like to save but don&#8217;t think I need is there. Old word docs, PDFs, blog post ideas I scrapped. I also store some notes that isn&#8217;t just plain text in there. Great service with apps for. Or less anything. And byword have a pretty cool Evernote integration.



**DayOne** is my journaling app of choice. I throw in some images, but not many. I transcribe all of my paper notes and journaling entries into Dayone. It makes it easy to tag, find and manage. And it sync between all of my devices.



**Adobe Lightroom** is my photo editing and management tool. All of my photos from my DSLR ends up here.



**Readkit** is my rss reader., and news source.



**Marked2** is the worlds most powerful preview tool. I use it to preview scrivener and documents from byword. And I also use it to convert that output to formats like doc, PDF etc. Its great at the stuff it is designed to do. And makes reviewing documents before publishing as pleasant as it can be.



**Ember** is the last, this is the tool I use to save, sort and manage all kinds of pictures I either find on the net or take with my phone. In other words: all of the stuff that don&#8217;t belong in Lightroom, Evernote or Dayone.



**Moom** is the last, but one of the most important tools on my mac. Moom is a simple utility that makes it easy to resize and manage your windows on OS X.
