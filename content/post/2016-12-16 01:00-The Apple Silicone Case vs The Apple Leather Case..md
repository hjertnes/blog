title: "The Apple Silicone Case vs The Apple Leather Case."

    Most of the iPhone cases I see are so ugly that I think we need a word, because just calling them “ugly” should be considered a compliment. My personal opinion about cases until the iPhone 6/6 Plus design was unnecessary unless you wanted extra protection or features; like for example more battery power or to have a combined Phone-wallet.

    I’m not a huge fan of the current iPhone design, because of how slippery it is. It is not a new trend, but the problem became much bigger because of the rounded edges and the increased size. This means that most people do want some kind of case to avoid breaking their screen once a month.

    My experience to cases prior to the Apple’s own cases were bad for the most part. The only exception is TwelveSouth; their cases are awesome. Most cases are ugly. If you for some strange reason find one that does not look like shit, then it is very likely that it either don’t provide much protection at all, or in a way where it is very hard to get your phone in and out of your pocket.

    The thing I really like about both of the Apple cases is that you get a lot of protection, without much extra bulk, in a very attractive package. They look good, and they look like they belong on the iPhone(something you can not say about most cases).

    I used a Silicone Case on my iPhone during the first 12 months I had it, and now I changed to the leather case because it started to wear down after a year of drops and in and out of my pocket (I have no idea how many times a day).

    The only difference between the two (except for the $10 price difference) is a slight colour difference and the amount of grip. Both of them provide more grip, something I think is a much to avoid having the feeling you are going to drop it every single time you pick it up. But the silicone version provides much more grip than the leather. This is both good and bad. I absolutely love the feeling of holding and using my phone with the silicone case. It feels safe, and it would be very hard to drop it. But I prefer the leather case because it is smooth enough to make it easy to take it in and out of my pocket.

    This is my only problem with the silicone case. It can be a pain to take it in and out of your pockets.
