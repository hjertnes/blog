title: "iPhone screen sizes."
---

I have been trying to write something sensible about what I think about phone sizes for a while now.



My favourite size up until now is the original one, 3.5 inches. That was the size that had the perfect balance between screen real estate, and easy of one handed use.



It was easy to have a safe grip, without feeling it was flipping over. And it was easy to reach anything on the screen.



I have used my iPhone 5s since May now, and I have gotten used to the larger screen, but I don&#8217;t think it gives me much benefit. And my 4s still feels better.



The main problem with the 4.0 inch screens from Apple is that they just made it taller. It kind of makes sense, but I&#8217;m not a fan. It just feels too tall, and it&#8217;s not that comfortable to hold.



I like the iPhone 6 screen size better than the 5s. It is more balanced. But it is far from as nice to use with one hand. There are one thing I really like about it, and that is how much better it is to thumb type with two hands in portrait orientation.



The 6 plus is a category of devices I have never understood. And I don&#8217;t like them. I like to have two devices, one that is smaller, but powerful. And a iPad or iPad mini when I want a larger screen. I get why some people prefer to have one device, instead of two. It&#8217;s too big to be a usable phone for me.



I really hope that Apple will keep updating the 4.0 screen size moving forward. There should be room for three sizes in the cell phone market. One 3.5/4.0 inc model, one large and one ridiculous. I know people that like 5.5 inch phones, and I know people that used to buy the 17&#8243; MacBooks.
