title: "Finding the lenses you need."
---

If you have no idea about lenses, start with a 40mm (27mm on a crop system). It is between a 35 and 50; the two most popular prime focal lengths. Great everything from portraits to street and general "snapshots". 

The next step would be to decide what else you would like: more flexibility (zoom), something wider, something longer or something faster? Where and how you'll shoot will also be an important factor. Because if you shoot stuff that moves fast you'll want fast autofocus, if you walk around with it a lot you want something light. But if you shoot in a studio you don't care about either. 

The f-stop number on a lens tells us how "fast" it is or how much light it can let it. Lower number, larger hole. Lower number means more glass, more glass means heavier and slower autofocus (because something has to move all of that glass to focus). 

I personally always try to find the fastest light combo. Like with my Fuji I always go with the F2 line of lenses. There are faster versions of similar focal lengths (like f/1.2 and f/1.4) but they have slower autofocus and are much heavier. One of the reasons I take as many photos as I do, is because almost all of my lens combos are very small and compact.
