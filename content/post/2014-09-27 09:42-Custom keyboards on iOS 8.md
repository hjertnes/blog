title: "Custom keyboards on iOS 8"
---

I started writing a longer piece about custom keyboards in iOS 8. Before I realised that I could cut it down to the basics.



Custom keyboards in iOS 8 is amazing, we finally have a TextExpander that have the same universal power, as the OS X counterpart.



We also have something that might be even cooler as we move forward. Custom keyboards will enable developers to make new and improved ways to input text on iOS; like what Swype are doing, by just &#8220;swiping&#8221; the word, instead of typing. Or what SwiftKey are doing with the best prediction engine I have ever seen.



The default keyboard have also gotten a facelift, with a prediction engine, instead of autocorrect.



I&#8217;m Norwegian, and most of the good keyboards available for iOS don&#8217;t support it. My iOS typing is 50/50 English and Norwegian. So, I have to stick with the default one, for now.



I&#8217;m going to keep my eye on both SwiftKey and Swype in the coming weeks and months. And I really hope either one or both get support for Norwegian.
