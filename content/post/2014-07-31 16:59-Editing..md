title: "Editing."

This blog have been, and is my favorite creative outlet. It&#8217;s the best thing I have ever done.



What this blog have been up to this point is a more or less unedited raw version of good ideas I had. I don&#8217;t think I have spent more time on most of them, than the time it took to write it. And then a quick glance, and minor tweaks.



I decided to change that a few months ago. I decided, but I didn&#8217;t do it. Yet.



This is the last post I will write, before I start to focus more on editing and to focus on making every single post as good as they can be.



I know I should have done the change earlier. And I also know that it is something I had to do sooner or later.
