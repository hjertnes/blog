title: "Getting started with Emacs"
---

Emacs is one of the most powerful programs I have ever used. The way I usually describe it is imagine excel where the macro language is so powerful that most of excel itself is implemented in it. Others have called Emacs a "big repl". The difficult thing about Emacs is getting started with it. Emacs is very powerful, but it isn't optimised for beginners. I personally think that is great, because it means it have been built for those of us who spend most of our time in it. 

I recommend that you start with one of the configuration systems available. At least in the beginning. Spacemacs is awesome, because it is really easy to get started with. Before you move on look at both the regular Emacs Keybindings and VIM / Evil keybindings and pick the one that appeals the most to you.
