**Patrick Rhone:**



> Recently, my friend Garrick and I came up with the following thought exercise: If you were to design the perfect shopping mall, what types of stores would it have? The rules are simple. It does not have to be existing brands or even what one would find in the modern American mall â€” just types of stores. To keep it easy we limited ourselves to ten. 



Neat idea.
