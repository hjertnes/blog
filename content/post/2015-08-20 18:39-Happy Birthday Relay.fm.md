I meant to have something ready for the day, but that didn&#8217;t happen. Anyways. Here it is.



It is amazing to see what Myke and Stephen have done in just one tiny year. Relay have moved from a brand new podcasting network with some of my favourite shows, to my favourite network.



I have been listening to Myke Hurley for a long time. The first podcast I started listening to was Enough, which is still my all time favourite podcast. I&#8217;m not 100% sure about the time. But it was either right before he started 70 Decibels, or right after.



Everyone should check out Myke&#8217;s podcasts, and the rest of the [Relay.fm][1] shows. There are something there for everyone.



Congratulations on the first year!
