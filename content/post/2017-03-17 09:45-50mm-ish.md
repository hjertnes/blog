    The first lens I bought, ever, was the 40mm pancake. I got it when I bought my Canon EOS 650D(also known as the Rebel Rebel T4i), and the funny thing is that it took months before I even tried out the kit lens.

    One of the great things about the 40mm focal length is that it is slightly longer than 50mm on a crop sensor system (40 x 1,6 = 66mm), and well 40mm on a full frame system. This lens is loved by both full frame and crop sensor shooters, and is still to this day one of my favourites.

    I personally love it because it is fast (f/2.8), takes amazing pictures, it is small and light.

    My main go to lens these days is my Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 zoom lens, because it is so versatile and give me more or less everything I could need for almost anything I need. I also have two other cameras that are very small and compact(Fuji x100t and Nikon FM) but this setup is also a great option, if I want digital. Mostly because this camera can without problems survive at least a whole weekend on one battery, and I would be stretching it if I said that my Fuji survived a afternoon.

    There are some stuff I believe everyone with a camera should own, and a lens like this is a must for when you want to make your setup as small and light as possible. For example when traveling, or shooting one handed.
