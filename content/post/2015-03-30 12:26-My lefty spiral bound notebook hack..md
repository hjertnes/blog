title: "My lefty spiral bound notebook hack."
---

I think spiral bound notebooks are the best, because they make it comfortable to write in a notebook, no matter if you are on the first or the last page.



But, there is a problem, I&#8217;m a lefty, and that damn spiral is always in the way.



My problem to this have always been to flip the book over, and to start from the back.



It is a great way get a &#8220;lefty notebook&#8221;.



It is kind of weird, when I think of it, that there isn&#8217;t left handed notebooks.



Every lefty out there should try it!
