title: "Thoughts on Spacemacs after using it for a while."
---



I have been a Spacemacs user for a while now. And I do enjoy it. Like a lot. Most of what I enjoy is how awesome Emacs is. And how easy Spacemacs makes it to deal with it. For example the layer stuff is a little bit difficult to get started with, but it is awesome. 



Let me be perfectly clear: I would not trade spacemacs for anything. I use it, and will probably continue to do so for a very long time. 



But there are some things that I don't like. It seems like Spacemacs is a little bit "heavy", it takes a very long time to start compared to plain Emacs. And stuff can be a little bit unstable. I'm not saying it is their fault. I just hope that some of it will be fixed with the 0.300 release. And that to make stuff faster and more stable is a priority moving forward.
