title: "My e-mail setup."
---

E-mail is crap. Sorry, but I had to say it. I have tried it all, There would be at least two home screens full of e-mail apps on both my iPhone and iPad if I installed them all. And I would spend a fortune if I had an active subscription to all of the cool and interesting e-mail hosting and related services that I have tested.



My current setup is quite simple. I host my email account at [FastMail.fm][1] and I use [MailRoute][2] for spam filtering. And I use the standard Apple Mail.app applications on both iPad and Mac.



I don&#8217;t use the because they are the best, but because they are good enough. I found out something interesting when I moved from a few a bit prettier and fancier apps to then stock ones, last year. And that was that I spend far less time, &#8220;doing e-mail&#8221;, if I used worse apps.



You need to find out what works for you.
