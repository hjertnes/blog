# Todoist.



I have been using Todoist for a while now, and I really like it. Todoist is not that widly used within the Apple GTD community. But a lot of people do use it, everything from induviduals to large companies.



The first thing I&#8217;m going to do, is to run through all the other GTD apps I have used the last year, and explain my problem with them.



  * **OmniFocus** is a great set of applications. I used to to get stuff done for a very long time. But something changed in august 2013. It wasn&#8217;t for me anymore. Parts of it is how much hassle it is to set due dates and make recouring tasks. Date and time pickers are one of the things I hate the most; all of them suck.</p> 

  * **Things**. I went back to Things for a few days, just to test it. And I can&#8217;t use it. The whole project system is too limited for me. And their implementetion of recouring tasks is just weird.



  * **Taskpaper** is the closest I have found to a perfect solution. The only thing I miss from taskpaper is reminders and recouring tasks. 

  * **Reminders** is good for what it is. But that isn&#8217;t what I look for. It&#8217;s not for you when you work in a GTD way, with a lot of projects and a lot of tasks. 



**Todoist** is probably the first thing I should have tried when I realized that OmniFocus wasn&#8217;t for me anymore. But I wanted something &#8220;prettier&#8221;. The apps aren&#8217;t the best. Both OmniFocus, Things, Reminders and Taskpaper is way better. Both from a design and app persepctive.



  * It&#8217;s more flexible than Things

  * It scales better than Reminders

  * It have reminders and recouring tasks; the two things I miss with Taskpaper.

  * It&#8217;s just so much easier to use than OmniFocus. 



The thing I realised when I started using Todoist is that the app is just as good as it have to be. It handles many projects way better than most other apps; except for OmniFocus. Everything works just as good as it needs to be. But a lot of the really **pain in the ass** tasks are polished.



**Due dates** is one of the things that I either never got; or the thing no GTD app ever implemented correctly. Todoist have done something interesting. They let you set a due date, without a time. Which means I can set the due date to tomorrow on everything I need to do, tomorrow.



You also set &#8220;reminders&#8221;; e-mail or push notification. This means that I can create a task called &#8220;Do the dishes&#8221;, give it a due date tomorrow, and set a few reminders; for example at 12, 15, 18, and 21.



This is cool and all. But the thing that makes Todoist a killer app for me, in this context, is the interface. They have a regular date picker. Which I hate. You also have Fantastical style natural language style input. Which works on both due dates and reminders. They also added a few buttons: today, tomorrow, next week, in a month.



It&#8217;s awesome.



**Fremium**. The business plan is interesting. Most good GTD apps are paid. And most of them are a set of apps. And some of them have their own sync platform.



Todoist is different. Their apps look more or less the same on all platforms. I can&#8217;t make up my mind about it. It feels like a web app; a really good one. You have more or less the same interface if you use their OS X app, or their web site.



They have a very generous free plan, and I think most people don&#8217;t need much more than that. But there are three reasons I went for the Premium plan.



  * Task reminders

  * Task search

  * Productivity tracking.



It&#8217;s $29 a year. The thing I like about Todoist is that they have a subscription plan. I think the OmniFocus 2 for iPad would have cost me the same as a year of Todoist Premium.



Don&#8217;t take this the wrong way. I don&#8217;t have anything against paying for software. But there are some things where paying a subscriptions seems like a better idea.



Paying per year or month is a better idea, when you have something that are a crucial in your day to day life. It makes sure that the company behind it have a sustainable income, without having to grow their customer base all the time.



It all depends on the kind of app.



**Karma**. This is probalby the coolest thing about Todoist. They have managed to have a voluntary gamification element in their app. There are different levels, and you get point for using the app every day, and you get minus point if you don&#8217;t.



The reason I like it is that it makes it easier to keep using the app as much as you should.



**Real tags**. One of the many great things about Todoist is that they have real tags. I think the OmniFocus apporach to Contexts are okay. But the thing I love about tags is that you can do more with it. Let&#8217;s say you want to group it in many ways. Energy, where you can do it, and something else; like personal and work. Well, that is something you can&#8217;t do with OmniFocus. You can with Todoist.



**I&#8217;m sold**. The thing that really got my aboard with Todoist, is simple. They took something complex, and made it not simpler, but easier to use. I can use natural language to add due dates and reminders. They look at reminders and due dates as two different things. And they made it very simple to assign both tags, and to make &#8220;Filters&#8221;; which is the same as a perspective in OmniFocus. They have a very simple query language instead of the insane perspective interface OmniFocus have; a interface I never understood, after trying to learn it for over two years.



You should check out Todoist, if you aren&#8217;t happy with your current solution, or if you just like to test GTD apps. It&#8217;s great.
