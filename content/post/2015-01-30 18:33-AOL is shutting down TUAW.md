title: "AOL is shutting down TUAW"

TUAW is shutting down, and Macword isn&#8217;t what it used to be. I think some newer and smaller site have taken over what Macword and TUAW used to be. But I think it&#8217;s better to just shut down, than to do one cut back after another, after another, like Macword have done.



Sad news.
