**Patrick Rhone:**



> I’ve long had an issue with giving and reviving greeting cards for special occasions. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment involved and enjoy a really well designed one, but I’m never quite sure what to do with them after you have read them. Do you put them in a keepsake box? Do you scan them? Put them in a drawer? Throwing them away always felt wrong, somehow. But they otherwise just kind of hang around or go into a drawer and then are forgotten which also seemed wrong to me.

    

> Then, online somewhere (sorry, I don’t remember where) someone floated this idea: Instead of trading cards with a significant other, why not write messages back and forth to each other in a notebook. I loved the idea. To me, a notebook for this purpose seemed much more meaningful, long lasting, provided greater flexibility, and the chance that one would go back over past occasions to read and reminisce was far greater.
