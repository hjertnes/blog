title: "Life without Dropbox"
---

It have gone a while since I got rid of my Dropbox account now. The majority of my Dropbox use was syncing my folder of text files between my laptops and my phone. And I almost never used it on my phone. 

Then I started to look into alternatives. The obvious one is to use Git. And that's what I did. 

I have a cron job both on my MacBook and my ThinkPad that pulls, commits and pushes every minute. If there are any changes. And I use Working Copy on my iPhone; for the rare times when I actually need access to my notes when I only have my phone. 

It works great, bu the iOS experience could be better. But the solution as a whole is awesome. I can work with my notes anywhere that have git and a text editor. I'm not locked in to any syncing solution or any app. If git isn't my preferred solution anymore I could change to what the next thing is fairly fast.
