I've put together this super simple shell script to make it easier to update all your Arch User Repository packages: \[update-aur-sh\](https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/5fa78829ef8104acf34479cff5c21517). The big if is that you need to check out all the AUR git repo's to one folder, and just change the script to reflect where you place them.



I kind of wish there were some better built in tools to manage AUR packages though.
