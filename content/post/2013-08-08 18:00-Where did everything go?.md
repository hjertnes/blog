title: "Where did everything go?"

Relax everything is still up, just go [here][1]. Like I wrote about in my [last][2] blog post in the old blog â€“ I am going to dedicate all my blogging related focus to writing fewer, better and longer pieces.



And the current blog have been through so many different formats and blogging engines that I decided to start blank, and just move the old one to another url. The old content will continue to exist in the current form for a while, but not forever.



I don&#8217;t subscribe to the idea that everything on the internet should exist there forever in whatever form it was created in. I&#8217;m not 100% sure what I am going to do with the old content, but I know that I will sort it, and move some of it into its own &#8220;blogs&#8221; here on this site, delete some of it and also do some rewriting and merging of articles.



I hope you enjoy the new format, and the new content.



And yes I know that I just broke every link to my site, and blog that exist on the internet. Do you know what? I could not care less.
