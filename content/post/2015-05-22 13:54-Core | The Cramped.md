title: "Core | The Cramped"

**Patrick Rhone:**



> Since early this year, I have been compiling a Commonplace book Iâ€™ve called Core. The idea was taken and slightly modified from one Shawn Blanc floated called Core Curriculum. The idea is to develop a book of core knowledge, passages, articles, books, quotes, recipes, instructions, and conversations that have shaped us, helped us, taught us, had deep meaning, or otherwise inform the core of who we are and what we believe. This is a living document, formed slowly and intentionally, and one meant to be reviewed every year or more often as needed. 



I love the idea, and I&#8217;m going to do this some day.
