title: "Journaling should be simple."
---

I&#8217;m a [Day One][1] user. And I have been using it for a very long time. But, sometimes I download and test some other journaling apps, just to see what&#8217;s out there.



Most of the major ones are pretty nice. But there is three things that Day One get, that all the other ones don&#8217;t get.



_Simplicity_. Some of them have very complex interfaces. That&#8217;s such a turn off. They make the difficult process of journaling harder than it have to be.



_Dated_. Some of the alternatives out there look dated. The thing I love about Day One is that updates for new major releases of OS X and iOS are usually there on Day One, or a few days later. And that is important. I want to use a product I know is supported well for journaling. It might be the most important app on my phone and laptop.



_Hard_. The last, and maybe the most important thing a lot of the alternatives don&#8217;t get right is how many clicks it is to start a new entry. Day One have two large buttons on the top of their iPhone app. One for writing, and one for adding either a new or existing image. It&#8217;s great. I know it&#8217;s one click to start.
