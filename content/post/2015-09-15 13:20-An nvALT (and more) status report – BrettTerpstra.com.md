> nvALT will (probably) see one more update. We (David Halter and I) fixed the majority of bugs that cropped up with OS 10.10 almost a year ago. The source on GitHub is up to date, but we haven’t gotten around to putting out an official update. I haven’t tested it on 10.11 yet, so if there are some minor patches needed to get that smoothed out, they’ll go out with that release when it’s ready. 



I really look forward to the final update, and I can&#8217;t wait for the successor. nvALT is probably the mac app I rely the most on. And the lack of updates have been worrying.
