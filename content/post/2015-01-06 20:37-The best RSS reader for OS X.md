title: "The best RSS reader for OS X"
---

**The Sweet Setup**:



> Reeder is the best RSS client for Mac OS X users. It syncs with lots of third-party services, looks good, and makes it easy to share content with others. 



I used to use Reeder 1, in my Google Reader days. Then I moved on to ReadKit, when I moved over to FeedWrangler. And I have been using it since then. My reasons for not buying Reeder 2 is simple: I don&#8217;t like the design, and ReadKit looks better; and the performance difference between Reeder and ReadKit isn&#8217;t a big deal for me.



A OS X version of Unread would be interesting.
