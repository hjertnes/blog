title: "The ethics of modern web ad-blocking &ndash; Marco.org"

Great post.



I don&#8217;t have a problem with ads, like I have said many times before. But I do have a problem with all the shitty tracking crap most ad companies use. Like Marco I have installed Ghostery, and I will look into content blockers when iOS 9 is out.



The ad companies have crossed a line, many times, and they force more and more people over to stuff like Ad blocker and Ghostery every time they cross it. They only have themselves to blame.
