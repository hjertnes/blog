title: "‘Storage & memory in Apple devices’"
---

My brother, and two friends of mine have talked to my about buying three different Apple devices the last few days. And these conversations have reminded my about something that always drive me nuts about Apple.



**iPad and iPhone.** I have to do this dance every time someone talk to me about buying an iPad or iPhone. I have to explain to them why it is a really really really bad idea to buy the 16GB model. My opinion is that the 16GB model should have been removed either with the 4S or 5. And we still have that option with the 5S. Two years after I thought it should be removed.



No one I know with an iPhone or iPad could get away with the smalles model. Everyone get into apps, or starts to load a lot of content onto their devices. Don&#8217;t buy the 16GB model.



Seriously. My mother whom never owned a computer before her first iPad, and that only owned one flipphone before her first iPhone have a lot of apps.



**Macs.** I have a very similar conversation every time someone have decided to buy a mac. Memory. Most people that are going to buy a mac, think it is expensive. And after that I have to talk them into spending a little more to double it, the memory. No one should get any computer with 4GB of ram in 2013.



Extra memory is an investent. You should get at least 8GB in your computer, or even more if it supports it and you can afford it. Extra memory is the single most important thing you can do to your computer to extend the number of years the computer is useful and enjoyable.



I know why Apple is doing these things with both memory and storage, they do it to make their product cheaper. Please Apple, be more proactive when it comes to upgrading default memory and lowest storage tiers on your products. It makes the buying process for regular people a lot safer. And it is not a good experience for the user to have to either delete a lot of stuff they want to have, or to sell and buy a new phone after a while because the 16GB limit is too small.
