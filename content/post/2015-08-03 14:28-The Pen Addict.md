Great review of my favourite planner. I use my every single day to plan short term, long term and to keep a log of the highlevel stuff I was working on.



I use the Hobonichi Planner, since it is the only one available in English, but I would consider the others if or when they are available in English.



You can use them for many different things. Some people use them as a log, while others use them to journal, and of cource planning.
