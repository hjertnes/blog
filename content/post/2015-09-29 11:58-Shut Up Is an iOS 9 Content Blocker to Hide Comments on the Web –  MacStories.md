title: "Shut Up Is an iOS 9 Content Blocker to Hide Comments on the Web –  MacStories"
---

> I&#8217;ve been testing Shut Up for iOS 9 over the summer, and it&#8217;s the Content Blocker I prefer for hiding comments. What I like about Shut Up is that, besides being based on Frank&#8217;s stylesheet and working well for the websites I visit, it offers a whitelist to specify websites where you do want to see comments – either because they usually have great conversations, or because they&#8217;re meant to be read as &#8220;comments&#8221; (such as Facebook or Reddit threads). Shut Up comes with a built-in list of allowed sites, and it also detects URLs in your clipboard when you open the app, letting you easily whitelist its domain. 



Fantastic!
