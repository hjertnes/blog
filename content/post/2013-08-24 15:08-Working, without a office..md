title: "Working, without a office."
---

I really hope this is my final draft of this text. It all started as a response to the whole &#8220;home working&#8221; thing; combined with me going back to school and this being the first time since I was 18 where I don&#8217;t actually have a set place where I do the majority of my work.



There are a lot of reasons for having a dedicated place for doing all of your work, and I do know that it makes you more productive in general; but it is also a good idea to work from somewhere else a few times a week.



One quick note before I move forward; I still have access to my employers office, but I don&#8217;t like to go there when I don&#8217;t work for them. It&#8217;s just a bit combination between me mainly focusing on what I should be doing when I am there and a lot of distractions when I am there.



**Setup.** So everything I need to do 90% of my work can be backed into my messenger back or a backpack within two minutes.



  * Pens + refills

  * Notebooks and Index cards

  * Macbook Air

  * Books; the ones I need, nothing else.

  * 30pin USB cable

  * Macbook Air power-brick

  * Water bottle. 

  * Camera



As you might expect, there are a lot of stuff missing from my bag. I don&#8217;t have my kindle, iPad or that much fancy stuff at all.



I can probably fit everything I would ever want to use in my backpack if I wanted, but this makes it harder to find the stuff I need, and a lot heavier to carry.



How often do I use my Kindle or my iPad when I am not either on my couch at home or traveling? Almost never.



You might wonder what the logic behind not carrying an iPad, but brining my DSLR with me; I take pictures almost every day. And to having to go all the way home when I decide to go for a trip and taking some pictures is more of a hassle than to just always having it in my bag.



Let&#8217;s get back to my main point. You should be able to get started doing something productive within a minute, if you are carrying your whole &#8220;office setup&#8221; in a bag of some sort. That&#8217;s the main reason for not carrying everything you might need; you should rather just carry the stuff you need in most situations.
