I got this idea while fundraising today: what is my all time favourite iPhone app?



My all time favourite app is DayOne. The thing about DayOne is that it is a pleasure to add pictures, write a few words or write many of them. But it&#8217;s also a pleasure to just browse through your journal and discover moments and thoughts you didn&#8217;t remember.



Everyone out there that want to get into journaling need to get [DayOne][1]. My personal preference is to have it on my phone. But the Mac app is also great for when you want to write something longer.
