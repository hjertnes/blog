title: "The Benefits of Selling Software outside the Mac App Store"
---

Dan Counsell from Realmac Software writes about the benifits outside the Mac App Store.



> When you get swept along in the shininess of the App Store it’s easy to forget that you no longer know who your customers are. You don’t have any of their details, you can&#8217;t even respond to them when they leave a review on the App Store. The fact of the matter is they are really Apples customers, not yours.

    

> When you sell directly outside of the Mac App Store you get the contact details for every single person that buys your products (and rightly so), this is often overlooked but it’s key to running a healthy and sustainable business. Lets take a look at three of the reasons why not limiting the availability of your software to just the Mac App Store is a sound business decision. 



A very good article. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the Mac App Store, mainly because I think they are excluding too much. But I use the Mac App Store, when I can. My personal opinion is: sell your software directly, sell it in the App Store, if you can and try to have direct contact with your users.
