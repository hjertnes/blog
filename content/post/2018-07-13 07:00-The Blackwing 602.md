title: "The Blackwing 602"
---

I started out with the Blackwing "MMX", and I immediately knew that I probably should have gone with the 602. 

This pencil is awesome. IT is not a  "HB", it is a little bit softer and smother than all of the HB pencils I have used. But it feels like a very good compromise between point retention and smoothness.

Where I usually wanted to re-sharpen my MMX after half a A5 page, this pencil I can get through at least a full A5 before I want to stop and sharpen it. Other than that it feels a lot like the MMX. It is very comfortable to use and is obviously a premium pencil. 

The design. It looks really good, even though to colours etc are not my kind of thing. I think both the MMX and the Pearl look much better than the Grey and Gold on this one. 

I would probably have liked it to be a little bit harder, but if you are going to use the pencil for writing long form I'd go with this over the other Blackwings.
