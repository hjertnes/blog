title: "Spaces in Yosemite."
---

Spaces was my favourite feature introduced in OS X 10.5 Leopard. This is a feature that you will find in most Window Managers and Desktop Environments, if not all for X Windows. In other words: all old Linux and Unix users know what they are.



The problem with Spaces, Workspaces or whatever you call them is not power users. The problem is make it understandable and approachable for regular users.



The version that shipped with 10.5, was more or less the same as what I had in Linux many years before, then Apple started to really improve on the idea with 10.7. But I think it is now, with 10.10 that they finally cracked it.



The big change is of course to combine Maximise and Full Screen, in the same green button. It makes the whole idea of spaces more approachable for most people. Not because it is better, or anything; it isn&#8217;t. But it makes it impossible for any OS X user to avoid it.



Spaces and full screen apps is powerful features; but they shouldn&#8217;t be considered power user features; they should be something everyone uses.



I hope 2014 will be the year people finally started to use them. They are one of the best ways be more productive on a smaller screen. It&#8217;s not as good as having a larger screen, or multiple screens; but it is almost as good.
