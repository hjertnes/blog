David Sparks, on Gruber&#8217;s Interview with Phil Schiller:



> One part of the interview that stood out for me started at 57:22. I was pretty close to the stage at this point and Phil explained, “I’m in my job for one reason. Because I’m a customer like you.” Reading these words, I’m sure you are thinking that this is just a marketing guy being the “marketing guy”. However, you would be wrong. Go listen to the recording. I was watching him as he stated these words and they were completely genuine.
