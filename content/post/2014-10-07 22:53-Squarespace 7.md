[Squarespace][1]



> Today, we’re thrilled to announce Squarespace 7, our largest update in two years. Squarespace 7 features a completely redesigned website manager interface, a deep integration with Getty Images, a cover page builder, an integration with Gmail and Google Apps for Work, 15 new category-specific designs, and much more.

> 

> Squarespace 7 is the result of a year-long effort to refine the simplicity of our platform while retaining its power. The biggest change you’ll notice is in our interface; you can now make live edits in your website without switching back and forth between preview mode and your Website Manager, and we&#8217;ve annotated every editable element on your site to make everything easier than ever. We&#8217;ve also reorganized our menus to create a more intuitive experience overall. 



There aren&#8217;t many news that are more exciting for me than major updates to the Squarespace platform. One exception might be iOS and OS X releases. I can&#8217;t wait to get access to the beta.
