title: "Henry David Thoreau on Journaling | The Cramped"
---

**The Cramped:**



> I’ve begun digging my way through Henry David Thoreau’s Journal and am struck by how many of his early entries are, like mine and I suspect many others, filled with angst and doubt about the purpose of such an exercise. I find it quite comforting to know that even one of literature’s great writers and thinkers struggled to keep a journal, questioned the entire idea of it, did so only in fits and starts, but kept at it all the same. And, by doing so, even haphazardly, bore such great fruit and insights about nature, philosophy, community, and solitude to be enjoyed well over a century later.
