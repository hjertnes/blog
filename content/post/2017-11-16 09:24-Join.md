<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  Join is a method living on the String prototype. All it does is to take a list of strings and combines them into a string, either with or without a dividing character. Very useful if you have a array of something that you want to list out seperated by a comma or something like that.<br /> Below is an example, both with Join and I also re-implemented join as a reducer, just because they are so similar; but reduce is far more powerful.</p>
