My favourite internet person, [Patrick Rhone][1] launched a new website. [The Cramped][2] a few days ago.



The Cramped is site site about analog writing. Pens, paper, notebooks, and even typewriters. It&#8217;s without doubt the site I have been spending the most time on since it launched.



I think it&#8217;s great. Interesting links and good articles.



Check it out!
