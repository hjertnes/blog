So let's say you want to change the speed you listen to podcasts; or audiobooks. 

Then you need to do it step by step. How I have done it this time, when I have gone from what ever is the maximum in Overcast to around 1,5x is that I have moved it down one step. And then I listen at that speed, not just until it sounds normal, but beyond that. Because when you slow things down people sound like stoners, but it also feels boring. What I mean by that is that you have this annoying feeling in the back of your mind: oh my god, this is so slow. 

I just continue to listen until I stop thinking about it, and then I move another step. If you listen to a lot of podcasts I think one step per week is a good pace.
