title: "A few words for Aron Swartz."
---

I just watched &#8220;The Internet&#8217;s own boy&#8221;, and he truly was that. Aron created RSS. Aron created Reddit. And he was fighting for a lot of the stuff that I have been fighting for in my own country for a long time. Both in terms of internet and environment. And as a Greenpeace employee, civil disobedience is the thing I believe in.



There are a reason behind this. I didn&#8217;t write the day Steve died. And I didn&#8217;t write the day Aron died.



But I&#8217;m writing this today. I have cried three times since I was a teenager. It was the day Steve died, it was the day Aron died, and when my grandmother died last year.



Aron was fighting for the internet we all want. Watch the movie. Spread the word, and continue the fight.



Civil disobedience is important. It&#8217;s the key, and it&#8217;s the solution, in the end.
