I think John is right, it took Apple a long time to allow custom wallpapers on iOS, four years, and four major OS releases, before we got it. But this seems so much worse than a ugly wallpaper, and Apple rarely lets us modify the interface of their products more than they have to. And custom watch faces isn&#8217;t something they have to.



They might do it in the future, but I don&#8217;t think so.
