Fantastic post about personal journaling.



It is a struggle to journal. I do it more or less every day, but it started out as something I did once a month, then once a week, before I slowly turned it into a daily thing. And I also write more important essays and &#8220;stories&#8221; in my journal first, some of them might show up here, as some point, while others don&#8217;t.



My advice about journaling: first you need to really wanting to do it, then you need to force yourself into the habit; and don&#8217;t start with doing it daily; weekly is enough; and then take a [NAJOWRIMO][1] challenge.
