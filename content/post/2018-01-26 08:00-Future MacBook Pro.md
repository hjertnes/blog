I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a huge secret that I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of the current incarnation of the MacBook Pro. But there are also stuff I love about it.



Let&#8217;s begin with what I don&#8217;t like:



  * Keyboard. I don&#8217;t care if they make the kind of keyboard I prefer. But I do want a keyboard I know will work reliably all the time. All my MacBooks up until this one have given me that. Apple got to either fix their current keyboard, or go back to the old one and make sure that they are reliable. 

  * SD slot. This is not a must. But my life and the life of everyone that owns some kind of camera would be better if it was built into the machine. 



What I like:



  * USB-C. I love that thing. I can use the same brick to charge my iPhone and my Mac. And I can also get power over the same cable I use to connect an external screen to my Mac. (I use the LG 27&#8243; USB-C screen; I have one at home and one at the office). 

  * Screen. It&#8217;s awesome. 

  * Function key row versus Touch Bar. This should not be a separate model, but rather an option.
