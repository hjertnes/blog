title: "Jekyll 3.0.0.beta1 Released"
---

The first beta version of Jekyll 3.0 is out. They have a lot of cool features on the way. This beta version mainly feature:



>   1. Speed. Jekyll now features incremental regeneration and greatly improved problematic code that caused slow-downs.

>   2. Gobs of bugfixes and customization.

>   3. Uniformity and sanity to Jekyll extensions of Liquid.



It looks great, and I can&#8217;t wait for the stable version.
