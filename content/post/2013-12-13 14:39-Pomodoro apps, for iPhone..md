title: "Pomodoro apps, for iPhone."
---

Pomodoro is my favourite productivity hack, when I really really really need to focus and get a lot done, in a very short time. I use the technique all the time, when I have pressing deadlines, or is preparing for exams. The basic principle is that you set a timer for X number of minutes that you work, and then you have a set number of minutes that you have a break. And after four rounds(or what ever you want) you have a longer break.



I have been looking for a good app for doing this for as long as I have owned an iPhone. But it wasn&#8217;t before today that I actually found one I liked. Most of the former apps have been a bit too much for my taste. They were either very ugly and hard to use; or too much. I don&#8217;t want my pomodoro apps to have stuff like task management. I just want a clean and simple interface to do the pomodoro stuff, and a easy to understand settings page to set up number of pomodoros(rounds) before a long break, and to be able to set how long each timer should be.



[Pomodoro Timer][1] is the app. It&#8217;s priced $1.99 at the app store.



You should get this if you are like me, and want a pomodoro app that is just that – a pomodoro app. It works great and got a decerving slot at my homescreen within an hour.
