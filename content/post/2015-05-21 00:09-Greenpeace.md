It&#8217;s good to see that Apple are doing great on this Greenpeace report, and Facebook isn&#8217;t that bad either, while Google isn&#8217;t doing that well compared to the two, but isn&#8217;t that bad overall.



I love it when my employer push companies like Apple, Facebook and Google to become better and to make sure that this planet are in better shape for future generations. Because our partens and grandparents fucked it up for us.
