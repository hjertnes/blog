title: "Two Alternatives To Field Notes."
---

> I love Field Notes Brand notebooks. I’ve been a customer since the beginning. In general, I purchace several packs of each &#8220;special edition&#8221; COLORS release. I find them both fun and functional. They’re built solidly enough and they break in well. Whereby, I tend to enjoy the patina they get and think they look even better when they are beat up and used a bit. As well, they have become very popular and enjoy an almost cult like following in the pen and paper circles.

    

> But, sometimes, one might want to enjoy something similar, but different. For one reason or another — perhaps something in a different size or price point. So, I thought I would suggest two possible alternatives. One that is a little bit smaller in size, yet higher paper quality and cost. The other a bit larger in size, yet slightly less in paper quality and cost. 



Having alternatives is always a good thing. I&#8217;m going to stick with FieldNotes for now. But this article is a good one, if you want something different.
