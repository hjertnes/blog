title: "My GitHub effort."
---

I have a shit load of code on my computer. Most of it is either in use or used to be in use; and was made to solve some kind of problem I wanted to solve. 

I have made an effort over the last year or so to make sure that as much of possible of the code I have laying around on my system is on GitHub in a form where it is useable to other people. 

Why? I don't know. Most of it was because I wanted to have more stuff there, I guess. And because it might be usable for someone. 

It is also a good exercise to get into writing code that don't need to be rewritten to be used by other people
