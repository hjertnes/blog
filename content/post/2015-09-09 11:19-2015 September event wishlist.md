Tonight is the big night; or night if you are here in Europe, and night if you are in the United States of Advertisment. And I thought I&#8217;ll list up some of what I would like to see.



  * **iPhone battery life.** I get the point that you need to shrink the iPhone 1/1000 of a inch a million time every single year, to go from the 3G to the 6, I get it. And, yes I get that it is Apple&#8217;s way to get better on power management than to increase the battery power. But I think it is time to get a larger battery. They should do both, improve power management, shrink everything, and give us a larger battery. 

  * **iPhone Camera.** There have been some talk about more mega pixels. I don&#8217;t want it. Because more pixels does not mean better pictures, just look at Android phones. And the cropping argument is bullshit. You need to be very steady and have a very low shutter speed to be able to do some meaningful cropping.

  * **iPad.** I think it&#8217;s time to give us a iPad mini that is as powerful as the iPad Air, and I think it is time to give us a huge one. 

  * **iPad keybaord.** Okay, this is the serious one about the iPad. Can we please get a proper Apple designed keyboard case for the iPad please? Without shrinking the keys. Something I can use to do some serious writing, if and when I need to. It will make the thing larger, yes, but I&#8217;m so sick of a million keyboards that are too small to do any real writing on. 

  * **Apple TV.** I don&#8217;t care that much about the TV part, but a lot of people do. But I would love to see the Apple TV turn into a living room hub, where you could connect various stuff to it; everything from printers, to USB drives and USB DVD players, and either connect it to your TV or Airplay to a display.
