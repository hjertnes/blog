I bought [Command-C][1] yesterday. And now I realise that I should have bought it months ago.



Command-C is a pair of iOS and OS X apps that let&#8217;s you &#8220;copy&#8221; or send stuff over to your iOS device. It&#8217;s not something I use every day, but I use it a lot. It might be some URL you want to browse on your Mac instead of your iPhone, or if it&#8217;s a podcast you want to add to Instacast on your phone.



It&#8217;s great.



This is something that should be a part of the operating system.



Anyways, it&#8217;s great app. and you should go and get it. The OS X app is free and the iOS app costs $3.99. Go and get it!
