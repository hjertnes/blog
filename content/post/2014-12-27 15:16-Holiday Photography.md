> On this week’s episode of The Weekly Briefly I’m joined by my former podcasting partner in crime, Ben Brooks. We talk about (a) what sort of camera you should buy if you want to upgrade from your iPhone, and (b) how to increase your chances of snapping a few awesome photos of friends and family during the holidays (and pretty much any other time). 



I have spent most of my days off since 22nd of December to get through most of my podcast queue. And this episode have been one of my favorites, this far.



Shawn Blanc and Ben Brooks talk about buying cameras. I think I agree on most of what they are saying. But I can&#8217;t get aboard on everything. This is how I think you should get into photography].



  1. Look at all the major players: Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fuji etc. 

  2. Figure out how big or small of a camera you need. Bigger cameras have larger and better sensors, while smaller are easier to carry.

  3. Find the brand that fit with you. You will be investing in a system. Everything you buy: body, lenses, flash etc will be for that system. You can always upgrade the body and keep your stuff later. As long as you stick with the same system. 

  4. Find something you love. Some people pick camera system based on how they look. And I get it, I do the same with computers, tablets and phones. But I have always picked cameras after how they feel in my hand. Canon and Nikon design their system cameras with ergonomics in their mind. A lot of other brands, don&#8217;t. 

  5. The most important thing is to pick something you know you will use.



Having a good camera is a great investment. You will get better pictures. But you won&#8217;t get great pictures unless you treat it as a craft.



Things have changed a lot in the last two years. There wasn&#8217;t much of a standard in the mirror-less camp. I have greater confidence in it now. I would still go for a regular Canon DSLR. But that&#8217;s just because I love them.



Find the system that you think fit you, try to hold different models in the store, to find the brand that feels right. And then buy the best lens you can afford. I would recommend starting with a prime; it&#8217;s a great way to learn how to shoot. And then spend the rest of your budget on the body.



The reason I think you should get a prime is simple. You get more for the money, compared to a zoom lens. And it enables you to focus on the camera settings.



[^0): What I mean by &#8220;getting into&#8221; is having it as your hobby. In other words: really learn it.
