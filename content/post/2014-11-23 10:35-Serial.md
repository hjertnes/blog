[This American Life][1] is without doubt a great podcast. But it never clicked with me. There are many &#8220;radio&#8221; podcasts that I just listened to in certain periods of my life. They created the first spin-off a while back called [Serial][2]. This is one of the best podcasts, I have heard in a very long time.



They have done something very interesting. The whole premise for the show is to back it with investigative journalism and use a season to present it.



You should check out Serial if you haven&#8217;t done it yet.
