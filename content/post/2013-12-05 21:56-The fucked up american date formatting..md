title: "The fucked up american date formatting."
---

There are many standards in the world, and most of them are redundant. We have the metric system, that most countries use, except for the US. There is the never ending Letter vs A4 war in the world of paper.



But there is above all one thing that I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand that should be an issue. The order of the numeric values in a date. To be 100% clear I do care what kind of character you use to divide them. I care about the order. Here in Norway we start with the day, then the month and at last we place the year. This is a logical system; smallest unit first and the biggest last, and the one in the middle – in the fucking middle!



And some countries do it the opposite way, no problem, it follows the same logic. It is logical.



But then we have the big annoying exception that is called The United States of America. They chose the one option that don&#8217;t contain any logic – at all. They start with the month, then the day and they place the year at the end.



Why?! What kind of crack head decided that this was a brilliant idea? Sounds like something out of the Bush Administration(the stupid bush, the second one).
