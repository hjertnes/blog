**Stephen Hackett:**



> My Relay FM co-founder Myke Hurley bought a 6 Plus back in the fall, and ever since, has praised the device for its superior screen, camera and battery life. It replaced his iPad mini and iPhone 5S both in one fell swoop. Heâ€™s been badgering me and many others for months about the superiority of the iPhone 6 Plus. I was excited to see if he was off his rocker or not. 



Excellent article about the 6 Plus. I&#8217;m not sure, if I want a bigger iPhone, and I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going for the regular or the Plus, if I want one.
