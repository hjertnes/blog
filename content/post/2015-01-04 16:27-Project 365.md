Stephen Hackett are doing Project 365 this year.



> &#8220;Project 365&#8221; is the name often given to photo-a-day projects. Starting today, I&#8217;m embarking on my fourth: 



I have been taking pictures of myself in DayOne, more or less every day for over a year now. I will continue doing that, but I think I&#8217;ll do Project 365 next year; I might sneak in a mini-Project 365 this year; not for the full year, but maybe a Project 30 or something.



I love projects like this. Project 365, NANOWRIMO, NAJOWRIMO. They are forcing you to do something you with you did more. Taking pictures, writing fiction or journaling.
