title: "Optimise for the problems you have. "
---

It is important to know what kind of problems you will get in the future. But remember: don't spend a lot of time optimising for problems that you might get. But rather design your software in a way where it is as easy as possible to deal with those problems as you can see the signs of them becoming a problem. 

Seeing how your users use your software is important to understand how you should optimise your database and code. For example, if you have a CMS with tags. There is no point in optimising it for a shit load of tags, if none of your users use more than five per post. Or have more than 50 different ones on their site.
