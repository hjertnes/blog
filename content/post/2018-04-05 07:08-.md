I'm digging Doom Emacs. My config is not ready for day to day usage yet. But I'm confident I'll get it there soon. 

Why am I considering to switch from Spacemacs?

- Prettier
- Easier Layer/module system
- Faster in general: both in terms of startup and general usage. 

But I think it is a little bit harder to get into than Spacemacs, and keyboard shortcuts etc are different.
