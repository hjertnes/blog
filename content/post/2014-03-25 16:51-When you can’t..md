title: "When you can’t."
---

Yesterday was one of the first times, since I can&#8217;t remember where I wrote, but didn&#8217;t. The truth is that I think I wrote five drafts, and about 7500 words. But none of them were what I wanted them to be.



The last time I did something like that, was last year; I think.



I believe all writers get themselves into that corner from time to time. There are just one thing to do: leave it, and try again some other time. What you did wasn&#8217;t a waste of time. You can always try to do something about the drafts some other time.



The way I work, when I decide to write for this website, is to either pick an idea from OmniFocus, or something from the top of my head. Then I write, and I just leave it in Byword if I don&#8217;t like it. And then I repeat it for a while. Most times I end up with something I think is _good_ after 1-3 times.



My philosophy to write is the following: &#8211; Keep every draft. They might end up as something great – some day.



  * Keep on writing.

  * Try – give it a real try; and take an early night if it&#8217;s one of those nights where you just can&#8217;t write anything good.

  * Get back to it the next day



You might not be the next Bukowski, but you will get a better writer, if you keep on writing.
