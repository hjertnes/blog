**Federico Viticci:**



> Version 1.1 of Workflow includes over 50 new actions and dozens of fixes, improvements, and changes to existing actions. Core parts of the app have been revised for a faster experience and the foundation laid with the Content Graph has started to pay off with the addition of metadata and filters. Because I&#8217;ve been playing around with Workflow 1.1 since the app&#8217;s original release two months ago, I&#8217;m going to offer some practical examples with a high-level overview of the changes.
