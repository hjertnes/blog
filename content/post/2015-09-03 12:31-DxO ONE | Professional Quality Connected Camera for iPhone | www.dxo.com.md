The DxO One is a fantastic idea. I have been a fan since I first saw it. And I think it is a must for everyone that love taking pictures with their phone, that want better pictures. It is not for me, though.



I love taking pictures with a real camera, and that is why I&#8217;m still going to buy a Fujifilm X100T instead of a DxO. But I know tons of people that should go for this inead of a proper camera.



Too bad it&#8217;s not available outside the US.
