title: "Pass: Im going back to 1Password"
---

I thought Pass looked interesting. So I decided to give it a shot. And it is a interesting idea. But I have decided to go back to 1Password because it is better. The user experience is much better, and pass felt too much like work. And the browser extensions was not reliable enough for me.
