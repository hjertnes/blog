title: "Why I care."
---

I sometimes write about both my thoughts, and problems about making money on apps, podcasts and websites. This might be odd to some people. But the reason is quite simple. I have a website, while I don&#8217;t have any podcasts or paid apps. I might get into them at some point. But I would love to be able to make money on my site at some point.



But the real reason I care is that I love the work indies and small companies are doing. For example app companies like [Tapbots][1] and [Agile Tortoise][2]; podcast networks like [5by5][3] and [Relay][4]; or writers like [John Gruber][5] and [Patrick Rhone][6]. Just to mention a few.



They all provide something large companies or media houses can&#8217;t. Small podcast network or indie podcasters test and do the stuff the large corporations can&#8217;t. Small app developers do all kinds of great and interesting things, that large companies can&#8217;t; and they can afford to make delightful apps, that target a small audience. While indie writers can do the kind of writing that I love to read; it&#8217;s not generic writing; it&#8217;s personal, something large websites can&#8217;t.



We need both small and large; but we need to figure out how to make both parts of the business sustainable.
