title: "Awt Facebook Forcing Some Team Members To Switch From Iphone To Android"
---

I had a similar experience in 2012, my phone died, and I told my boss I&#8217;d rather have a iPhone than a Android. And my boss told me that he didn&#8217;t want that, because I was developing an Android app. I responeded by telling them to stop paying for my contract, and by ordering a iPhone 4S, and most of all: by looking for a new job.
