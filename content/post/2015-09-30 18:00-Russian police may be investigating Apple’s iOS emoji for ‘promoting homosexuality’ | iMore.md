title: "Russian police may be investigating Apple’s iOS emoji for ‘promoting homosexuality’ | iMore"
---

> A new report claims that police in Russia&#8217;s Kirov region have started an investigation into Apple&#8217;s recent updates for emoji in iOS. The story claims that some of those icons, which were included in iOS 8.3 several months ago, could violate Russian laws that prohibit promoting homosexuality to minors. 



That law got to be the stupidest piece of shit legislation in recent time. It is impressive to make something worse than &#8220;The War On Drugs&#8221;.
