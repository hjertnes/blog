title: "Apple’s iOS 9 to have ‘huge’ stability and optimization focus after years of feature additions | 9to5Mac"
---

**Mark Gurman:**



> For 2015, iOS 9 is going to include a collection of under-the-hood improvements. Sources tell us that iOS 9 engineers are putting a “huge” focus on fixing bugs, maintaining stability, and boosting performance for the new operating system, rather than solely focusing on delivering major new feature additions. Apple will also continue to make efforts to keep the size of the OS and updates manageable, especially for the many millions of iOS device owners with 16GB devices. 



Yes, please. I don&#8217;t want more, I want better.
