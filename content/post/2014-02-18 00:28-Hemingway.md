[Hemningway][1] is the coolest web-app I have seen in a long time. And I want it as a desktop app on OS X, on my iPhone and iPad. This is one of these apps that I believe in. I believe it makes my writing better. And it could also make your writing better!



Here is the basic idea, you either write or paste some text into it. It highlights a few key aspects. Difficult sentences, adverbs.



It also highlights words and phrases that you should simplify and parts that you written in a passive voice. It also looks at how easy it is to read your text, on a grade level.



It’s a great app, every english language blogger that want to have a clear and bold voice should use this.
