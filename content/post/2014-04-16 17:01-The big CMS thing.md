title: "The big CMS thing"

Chose the CMS that is right for you. Pick Squarespace if you want something that &#8220;just works&#8221;.



There are a few important things I think everyone should consider before picking a cms. Are there any similar CMS they could &#8220;just move over to&#8221;? And do they have good export options?



This is the reason I don&#8217;t like Tumblr. There are nothing like it, and you are kind of fucked if you for some reason need to move over to something else.



I use WordPress. I don&#8217;t love it, but it&#8217;s the best thing available for me â€“ right now. I can post from Byword both on OS X and iOS. And wordpress plus a few plugins gives me everything I need.



And close to any web host can host a WordPress site.



The only thing I know for certain is that I will go over to a static cms at some point. It might be this summer, it might be later. I just need to find the one that&#8217;s right for me. And then solve a few issues I know about. Like blogging from my phone.



I chose WordPress because of the great clients available for it. And that&#8217;s kind of the main issue about static blogging engines right now.



Time will show.



Happy Blogging
