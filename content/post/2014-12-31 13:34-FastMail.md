> FastMail started with IMAP in 1999 when it was still quite new. We have been involved in the standards process, and have watched while non-open protocols led the way on features, usability and reliability. We pride ourselves on the standards compliance of our server, but we have been frustrated by the lack of progress in the third-party client experience available to our users.

    

> The fragmentation of server support for newer IMAP features means that clients either have multiple implementations of everything, with the complexity and bugs that involves, or fall back to lowest-common-denominator behaviour. Extending IMAP further just makes this situation worse. 



FastMail is my e-mail provider of choice. I have used them for a year now. And I think they are one of the companies that know better than most what pain in the ass e-mail and IMAP / SMTP is. They are doing something great here.



FastMail have their own protocol, JMAP. And they have made it public to have more interoperability, beyond IMAP and SMTP.



IMAP and SMTP are protocols from the past, before mobile, before push notifications. JMAP is made to address all of that. One of mine favorites is the support for batch operations. It means that they can bundle multiple operations in one API call.



A great protocol, I hope more providers on both ends start supporting it.
