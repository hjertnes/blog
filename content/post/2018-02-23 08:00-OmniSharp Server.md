title: "OmniSharp Server"
---

One of my favourite things Microsoft have made in the last few years is the OmniSharp Server.



The key to being happy about coding in languages like Java and C# is a excellent auto complete engine. And this is what the OmniSharp Server is. One of the reasons .NET have become so popular is that Visual Studio is so good, and the best part of it is the Intellisense engine.



The OmniSharp server is a server or service that other IDEÂ´s and text editors can use to integrate C# and F# auto complete. It is what Visual Studio Code uses, and I have also added it to my Emacs / Spacemacs setup.



It is a brilliant move. And I believe stuff like the OmniSharp server is the future of good software development tools. Every editor shouldn&#8217;t have to implement the same thing. It should be just a shared server that all of them can hook into.
