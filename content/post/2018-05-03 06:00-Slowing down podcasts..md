title: "Slowing down podcasts."
---

I have done a lot of changes lately. Trying to be a little bit more intentional about what I do where. For example restricting my phone to reading, listening etc. And removing apps for things like RSS and E-mail from it. Because I would rather spend my time consuming content than "processing inboxes" when I have time to kill. 

One of the things I have done is to slow down the speed I listen to Podcasts and Audiobooks. I have gone from "as fast as possible" to between 1x and 1,5x in the last few weeks. The result have been that I listen to way fewer podcasts. Because a lot of people are way less interesting at 1,5x. And it also feels like I have slowed down a little bit because of it. Or I as in my mind. Which is good.

I think it is a really good idea to hit the reset button now and then, and examine what you do and why.
