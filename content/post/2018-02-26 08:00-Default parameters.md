title: "Default parameters"
---

One of the first &#8220;you don&#8217;t support what??&#8221; moments with me and JavaScript was when I discovered that default parameters weren&#8217;t supported. We have managed just fine without them, but they care nice to have. And can save you a lot of work at times.



They are finally supported now.

If you only come from JavaScript, the basic idea is that you give the parameters you want to be optional a default parameter. Like in the example above.
