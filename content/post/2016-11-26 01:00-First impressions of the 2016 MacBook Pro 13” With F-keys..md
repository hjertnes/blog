    I went back and forth to this question like a million times between when Apple announced the new hardware until ordering one. My choice to go with the one with F-keys are as full of constraints as the machine itself. My need for a machine fast, and willingness to see where this touch bar thing goes was stronger than the more powerful machine with a touch bar.

    This was the first custom order machine to be delivered to my local Apple Authorised Reseller, even though many people ordered custom machines with the touch bar before I ordered mine.

    I love this machine. It feels much more dense and much smaller than my old MacBook Air. I have the same feeling I had when I went from the old pre-Retina 15” MacBook Pro. The battery is fantastic, it feels like a more powerful version of what I had. And I love the retina screen.

    The USB-C stuff is okay. Charging with it isn’t a huge problem, but I’m going to miss the MagSafe. It is a major pain in the ass – right now. But I expect that it will make docking take off, like it never did before it.

    I’m not sure what to say about the keyboard. My typos where flying like the racist, homophobic and misogynist profanities at a Trump rally But after ofter 24 hours and a few thousand words I feel okay about it. I can notice that I write faster on it. I might even like in a few week.

    I miss the glowing Apple logo on the back. I’m not sure why, but it have been a part of Apple laptops for as long as I can remember. The design brings their lineup to something that feels and looks much more modern than it have been in a long time. The MacBook Pro and MacBook Airs have been due for a while. The design have been more or less the same since the first unibody release, and then some revisions since then. And they started to look really old when the MacBook came out.

    I’ll write up a proper review as soon as I have used this machine for a while.
