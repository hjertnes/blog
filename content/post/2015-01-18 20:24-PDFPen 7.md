PDFPen 7 is out. A great update to my favorite PDF app. I have been using it since I discovered it on Mac Power Users back in the day. The great thing about PDFPen is that you can buy a fully featured PDF app, even though you only need it a few times a year.



It won&#8217;t cost you a fortune, something I can&#8217;t say, for Adobe&#8217;s PDF apps.



Great app, check it out!
