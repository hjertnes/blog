title: "A single Apple OS"
---



There was a lot of talk about the merging of iOS and Mac OS at the end of last year. And I never wrote anything about it, because I never made up my mind what to say about it. 



When people start to talk about a single Apple OS, I assume they are talking about making them more similar under the hood. Because I know I don't want OS X on my iPhone, and I certainly don't want iOS on my MacBook.



I'm certain that there is a "Core" that is maintained separately from OS X, iOS, TV OS, Watch OS etc. And that is the "Apple OS" everything Apple makes with Apps shares. And I think that Apple will, and I also think that it is in their interest to limit the differences between the platform as much as possible. One of them is to make sure that the API's on their platforms are the same, except for where there are really good reasons for doing so. 



If expanding from iOS to OS X would be more like adding an extra Storyboard to the Xcode project, I assume that it would be more of an option to add OS X to the supported platforms. This would solve many problems that both Apple and third party developers have. It is hard to maintain many different projects at once. And by limiting the number of them, and making them as similar as possible, without turning Y into X or X into Y, you could end up with more Mac Apps. And more Mac Apps adding support for iOS. For example the app I'm writing this blog post into (MarsEdit). 



I think the biggest issue with maintaining both iOS and Mac OS at this point is that even the most trivial stuff like a fucking colour is not the same across the different platforms. Making Apple's development platforms more modern is a story for another day.
