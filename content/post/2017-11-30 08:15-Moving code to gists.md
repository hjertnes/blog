title: "Moving code to gists"
---

For various reasons I have moved this site over to WordPress; none of them are very important in the grand scheme of things. Anyways. I have been spending quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to best deal with code in these blog posts. And I have come to the conclusion that the best compromise between work I have to do, and the best possible expereince for you as a reader of this site is to embed GitHub Gists.
