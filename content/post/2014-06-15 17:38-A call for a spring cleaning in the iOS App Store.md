title: "A call for a spring cleaning in the iOS App Store"
---

I wish Apple would do something radical about all the ageing apps in the App Store.



There have been a few evolutions that call for either a complete redesign or some minor updating since the store launched.



First we had the retina screens; a minor update in the developer & designer side. All you had to do was to provide graphics in 2x. And I don&#8217;t think it took long for most geeks to find an temporary or permanent replacement for the apps that wasn&#8217;t retina ready.



Then we had the iPhone 5. I haven&#8217;t been a victim for the letter boxing issue for a long time. But there are still apps, that I can&#8217;t find replacements for, that haven&#8217;t been updated. And it&#8217;s close to two years since the iPhone 5 shipped.



I have updated some iPhone apps to support both the old and the new size. It&#8217;s some work, but not a lot.



Then we had iOS 7. This was a golden opportunity for everyone to get up to speed. Most apps needed either minor or major updates. And a lot of apps have came out of the grave since iOS 7 hit the market.



While others haven&#8217;t.



I don&#8217;t think Apple will do anything about this. But I think they should. The best thing would have been to remove all &#8220;dead&#8221; apps. Especially if they don&#8217;t work at all on newer OS releases.



David Smith talked about one very intriguing idea on episode 52 of [The Prompt][1]. And that was that the Apple review team shouldn&#8217;t just review new apps. But also existing apps. _Ongoing review._



Some of the big problems with the current model is:



  1. There are so many apps, and most of them sucks.</p> 

  2. It would be so much easier to find the good ones if the old & terrible apps disappeared.



  3. Apple contacting a company about pulling their app from the store, might push them into updating it.



The whole idea of removing old and crappy apps is tempting. But it&#8217;s harsh.



There are two others ways Apple could attack it.



Shaming. I think Apple should punish all the companies that don&#8217;t follow up on updates. Just put a &#8220;Out of date&#8221; tag on all apps that haven&#8217;t been compiled against the iOS 7 SDK.



But the thing I think would be a lot better is to just hide them. Hide all the apps that haven&#8217;t been compiled against, well the iOS 7 SDK would be too much. But the iOS 6 SDK should work.



And just provide a filter setting for viewing &#8220;outdated&#8221; apps. Not unlike the option for viewing iPhone apps in the iPad App Store.



It&#8217;s about time for a real spring cleaning in the App Store.
