title: "Squarespace 7 – after using it."
---

The last time I posted about this, was a few hours after Squarespace announced version 7. I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to test it, at all, then. But I have been playing with it for a few hours – over a few days now. And I love it.



Squarespace 6 was one huge, and impressive update. But the admin interface was always a little bit too weird and messy for my taste.



They are fixing it in version 7. It&#8217;s in beta right now.



**This is what I love about version 7 this far:**



  * The new menu system in the admin interface is simpler, cleaner, makes more sense and is easier to navigate.</p> 

  * You don&#8217;t have to leave the admin interface to work with the site layout.



**This is what I don&#8217;t like:**



  * I can&#8217;t edit or write blog post in full screen. This was possible before LayoutEngine 2. 



Squarespace 7 is not the same kind of update that 6 was. But this is the kind of update that every Squarespace user will love. Not a huge amount of new stuff. But a lot of improvements, that some of us have been asking for, for a very long time.
