title: "Spread"

Spread is a very powereful expression that both makes some stuff easier, and makes other things possible that were close to impossible without it. What it does is to extract the content of either a array or an object. Below is an example showing how to use spread on objects and arrays to make a copy of them and to pass the content (not the array or object itself) as parameters to a functions. The object spread is also a very elegant way to pass dynamic data to React components.

I know I say this a lot, but this is one of my favourite modern Javascript features. One side note: the object version of spread is currently in draft stages.
