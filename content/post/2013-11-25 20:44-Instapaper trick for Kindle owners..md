title: "Instapaper trick for Kindle owners."
---

I spend most of my times these days: writing, reading and listening to podcasts. But still, I wish I had more time to spend on them all. On them all.



Anyway, I love the iPhone and iPad app for Instapaper, but that is not the way I read the majority of all the stuff I add to Instapaper.



The device I prefer to read on is my Kindle. The reason for this is that it is always in my coat pocket, and that it&#8217;s battery life is so good that I only need to charge it about once a month.



This is the trick. Once a month, I go into Instapaper, and start to download the ten latest articles into the Kindle mobi format, then I archive the 10 articles that was downloaded, and repeat this process until my Instapaper list is empty. Then I plug in my Kindle into my Macbook Air and transfer the files.



I sometimes read on my phone or iPad, but it is not often more than 1-2 articles. You know, I might start browsing through twitter or draft a blog post, like I am doing now. But, when I read and only read when I open my Kindle. If I spend two hours reading on my Kindle, I get through about ten times what I could get through during a week on any of my other devices.



This is one of the not that know features of Instapaper that every Kindle user, with a Instpaper reading list that they new get through should check out!
