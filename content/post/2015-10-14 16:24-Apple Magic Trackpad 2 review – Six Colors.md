title: "Apple Magic Trackpad 2 review â€“ Six Colors"
---

> I love the Magic Trackpad. And as of today, with the arrival of the Magic Trackpad 2, the Magic Trackpad is bigger and better than ever. 



It is a good refinement of the first good pointing device for a desktop, at least in my opinion. A trackpad, or a good one, and Apple is the only company that have made a good one, is very natural and intuitive, compared to all the others.
