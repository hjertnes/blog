<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  <p>

    This could be viewed as a remake of the technology focused site I had in various forms from 2009 until early this year when I deleted it, and that site was an extension of the many different blogs and sites I had since I started doing web development in my early teens.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    I had two reasons for deleting it:

  </p>

  

  <ol>

    <li>

      I had painted myself into a corner where I neither enjoyed what it was or writing for it.

    </li>

    <li>

      My main focus at the time was my <a href="http://inksmudge.net">Pen & Paper Blog</a>

    </li>

  </ol>

  

  <p>

    Then I started to feel the need for writing technology again. I think it started about six months ago, and now I think the time is right again. My original plan was to do it on medium, and having it be something I only did when I felt like it. But I posted one thing, and then I removed it 12 hours later because it didn’t feel right.

  </p>

    I looked at various places to start a blog, but I decided to go for a simple staticky generated web page, powered by a simple Swift Console Application I wrote yesterday. It is very bare bones at the moment, and I plan to work on it and maybe open source it at some point.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    I’m not sure how often or how much I’ll write. But it will at least be some.
