title: "Iterators"
---

An iterator is the underlying structure of arrays and everything else you can loop over using for example for-of. You probably don&#8217;t need to implement one yourself, unless you are trying to make something that is Lazy. A lazy iterator is when it continues to iterate as needed.



The basic idea is that you add a symbol (I&#8217;ll add a example below) that returns a object, with a next method, that returns an object with two keys: value and done; done is a boolean telling the code that iterates over the iterator if it is the last element or not.
