[Tim Cook: I&#8217;m Proud To Be Gay][1]



> I don’t consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I’ve benefited from the sacrifice of others. So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy. 



I read this article yesterday, when everyone else was linking to it. I didn&#8217;t have the time to write anything, but there it is. This is one of the best things I have read in a very long time.



The quote above is my favourite from the OP-ed. Activism isn&#8217;t for everyone, but doing something is. What Tim Cook is doing here, is to sacrifice something that obviously is important to him(privacy), for the greater cause; that is even more important.



Everyone should read it.



There are still assholes out there that think it&#8217;s okay to discriminate people on the color of their skin, their sexual orientation or their religion(or lack of religion). Seriously. Upgrade your values to 2014.



Everyone is different. Accept it. And embrace it.
