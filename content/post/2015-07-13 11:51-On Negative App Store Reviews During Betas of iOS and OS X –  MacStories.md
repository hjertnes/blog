title: "On Negative App Store Reviews During Betas of iOS and OS X â€“  MacStories"

**Federico Viticci:**



> What&#8217;s even more unfortunate is that this happens annually for every single iOS and OS X developer seed, but I fear the problem will be exacerbated this year by the availability of public betas anyone can try. Therefore, this bears repeating. 



This is a unsolvable problem. Many of the Public Beta / Developer Beta users understand that stuff won&#8217;t work and that developers can&#8217;t ship versions that build against the new OS API&#8217;s yet. But there are still many users that don&#8217;t understand this. It is unfortunate, and as always, I hope that Apple will do something about the review system.
