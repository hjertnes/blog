I just wrote about [Serial][1]. They are the fastest podcast to reach 5 million download, according to [The Guardian][2].



I was met with a &#8220;please donate&#8221; pop up, when I went to their website last night. It&#8217;s clear that there are some shows where ads alone might not be sustainable. Too limited audience or large production cost are two possible reasons for it.



I don&#8217;t mind ads on podcasts, most of them are good. But I think a combination of ads and listener support is the only sustainable way going forward. Unless we don&#8217;t want any experimental or only shows with huge audiences.



Even [5by5][3] are doing it. I think things like [Patreon][4] is great.



I have no idea where this will end, but I hope it is a place where podcasts are funded with a combination of ads and listener support.
