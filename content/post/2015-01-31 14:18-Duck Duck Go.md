title: "Duck Duck Go"

Okay, I&#8217;m trying to move over to \[Duck Duck Go\]\[0\] for the third time, in as many years. I don&#8217;t use that many Google Services, and I only use them if I have to. They don&#8217;t provide many services that I absolutely need. The exceptions right now, is Google Analytics, and Search.



I&#8217;m trying to replace Google Search for Duck Duck Go at the moment. The reason it didn&#8217;t work the last few times I tried, was bad support for Duck Duck Go in Safari on iOS and OS X. They have also redesigned the web site.



This is what I&#8217;m going to do. Duck Duck Go is going to be my go to search engine for at least a month. And I&#8217;m switching back if it doesn&#8217;t feel right after that.



Google Analytics is another thing. I&#8217;m not 100% sure what to do. Analytics is one of the things I&#8217;m not 100% sure if I want to pay for at the moment. And Google Analytics is good enough right now. But I&#8217;m going to do one thing this year. To figure out if it is something I&#8217;m going to continue with, and if I am, then I need a plan to move it away from Google.



This might be the year I move everything, except for the few people I talk on Google Talk with, and the few people I know that use Google Docs.
