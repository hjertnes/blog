title: "My pen blog."
---

I started a new pen blog a few weeks ago, it had at that point been in the words for a few months, and in the planning a few months before then. The motivation for spinning the occational pen and paper posts out of this site is simple:



  * It didn&#8217;t really fit in with the rest of what I was doing here

  * It frees me up to write more about pen and paper related topics, because it has a proper home.
