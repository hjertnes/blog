**Bill Maher:**



> If you’re a white guy, living in Texas, driving a pickup truck with a shotgun rack and a “Nobama” bumper sticker, isn’t the Confederate flag license plate a little redundant? We get it. You’re a redneck. I don’t know how we’re going to find moderate rebels in Syria when you can’t even find a moderate rebel here in America.

    

> Oh, wait. I found a moderate rebel: Robert E. Lee. General Lee – whose birthday was a week ago – was not a big fan of the Confederate flag. Writing for The Daily Beast, Jonathan Horn points out that, after surrendering the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in April 1865, Lee took an oath to support the US Constitution and advised fellow former Confederates to follow suit. So take that, Dukes of Hazard.
