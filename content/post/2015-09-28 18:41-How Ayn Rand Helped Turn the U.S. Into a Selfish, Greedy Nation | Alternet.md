title: "How Ayn Rand Helped Turn the U.S. Into a Selfish, Greedy Nation | Alternet"
---

> Only rarely in U.S. history do writers transform us to become a more caring or less caring nation. In the 1850s, Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) was a strong force in making the United States a more humane nation, one that would abolish slavery of African Americans. A century later, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) helped make the United States into one of the most uncaring nations in the industrialized world, a neo-Dickensian society where healthcare is only for those who can afford it, and where young people are coerced into huge student-loan debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. 



I hate Ayn Rand as a Philosopher, as a intellectual, and most of all as a human being; my hate for her, the person, and her, the ideas she stood for can&#8217;t be described with words. I expect I&#8217;m just as annoyed when I read or hear &#8220;Ayn Rand&#8221; as a biologists are when they hear about Creationism.
