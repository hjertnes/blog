title: "How to easily re-size the link bracelet on your Apple Watch | iMore"
---

I don&#8217;t post that much about the Apple Watch, because I don&#8217;t want one, and I don&#8217;t care that much, but this is cool. The link bracelet for Apple Watch is one of the things I want, because of how easy it is to customize it. To customize most link bracelets on regular watches inclues using a paperclip to push out pins, and it is a real hazzle. This is a example of where Apple is the best when it comes to innovation and improving on something everyone in an industry have been doing wrong for a long time.
