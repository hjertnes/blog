title: "Choosy â€“ A smarter default browser for Mac OS X"

Interesting app. I&#8217;m not in the market for it right now, but this is something I would have paid a lot of money for back in the day.



This is also a good tip for people that want Safari as their default browser, but want to use Chrome for everything related to Google.



Check it out, I know I will, the moment I need it.
