title: "My Growth as a Writer –"

**Harry Marks:**



> Reading is everything. It’s almost more important than the actual writing. I absorb the books I read and in turn churn my stories in my mind to thicken them up. To make them richer. And I don’t just read the literary powerhouses to enrich my writing. I read genre novels to observe pacing and romance and action. I read bad books to know what not to do. I read award winners, award losers, and books that wouldn’t be allowed within 50 feet of an awards stage. 



A fantastic post. There are three thing I focus on in my writing.



  1. Reading as much as possible

  2. Writing more and better, by writing more, and by focusing more and more on editing. 

  3. Taking one step at a time.
