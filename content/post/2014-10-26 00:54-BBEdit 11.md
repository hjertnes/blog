BBEdit and TextMate used to be the two text editors on OS X; like Vim and Emacs for hard core unix geeks<sup id="fnref-0"><a href="#fn-0" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>. I was a TextMate user for a very long time, more or less constantly from 2006 until today. TextMate was by the way the reason I bought my first Mac.



TextMate isn&#8217;t what it used to be. It became Open Source. And I have been looking for a better supported editor for a while now. And I have tried BBEdit many times. And I&#8217;m not the biggest fan. But I think I&#8217;ll give it a real test this time.



There are things from TextMate that I miss, but BBEdit is way better than TextMate 2. It&#8217;s supported and polished.



The good thing about BBEdit is that it just works. But it is kind of weird. I can&#8217;t decide if it&#8217;s just weird, or if it is better solutions to problems.



I&#8217;ll write another post, when I decide what to do. My current options is Vim or BBEdit.
