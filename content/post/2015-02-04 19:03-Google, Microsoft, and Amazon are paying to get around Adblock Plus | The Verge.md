title: "Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are paying to get around Adblock Plus | The Verge"

**The Verge:**



> Some of the web&#8217;s biggest companies have been paying to get around Adblock Plus, according to a new report from Financial Times. Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search ads and Taboola&#8217;s &#8220;recommended links&#8221; box are among the ads that are currently slipping through Adblock Plus&#8217;s filter, and FT confirms that it&#8217;s the intentional result of a paid deal between the makers of Adblock and the owners of the ads. According to FT sources, the companies have paid Eyeo (the maker of Adblock Plus) to be added to an official whitelist, which allows them to bypass the plug-in. Google has a similar deal, as has been previously reported. 



Seriously? This is both extortion and bullshit. I have mixed feelings about parts of the ad industry and the &#8220;ad blocker&#8221; industry.



Just deal with the fucking ads.
