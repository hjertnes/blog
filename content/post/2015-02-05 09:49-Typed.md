Interesting, very interesting. Squarespace is great, but I think it&#8217;s a little bit too much for people that just want to write. And I think there is enough options for people that want something self-hosted. Everything from WordPress to my beloved Jekyll. But there aren&#8217;t enough good options, when it comes to hosted solutions. Typed looks good, really good.
