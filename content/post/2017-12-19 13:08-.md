The latest version of Lightroom CC brings the file management features I was missing; it allows you to tell it to specify a location to store all of your originals that don't count against the cache storage limit. In other words; it also brings a setting to store all smart previews locally. I think Lightroom CC is slowly turning into a much better version of Lightroom Classic.
