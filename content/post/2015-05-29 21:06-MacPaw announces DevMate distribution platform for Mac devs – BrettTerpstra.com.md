title: "MacPaw announces DevMate distribution platform for Mac devs â€“ BrettTerpstra.com"
---

**Brett Terpstra:**



> MacPaw (makers of CleanMyMac 3, Encrypto, Listen for iOS, and more) has been developing a platform for Mac OS app development and distribution for a while. It started as an internal project for use with CleanMyMac, but is available today as DevMate, a tool for all Mac developers and vendors. 



DevMate looks interesting. And it is great to see 3rd party developers taking over an area where Apple have slacked off way too long. The Mac App Store is not a failure, but it could end up as one, if they don&#8217;t get their act together.
