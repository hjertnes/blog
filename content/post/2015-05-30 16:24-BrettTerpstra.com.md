Fantastic, I&#8217;ll be upgrading as soon as I get around to it.



The new features I look forward to is:



  * Snippet suggestions

  * Search for snippests inline



I have used TextExpander for a long time, and every new version have been great. But I think version 5 is the first release where it feels like they are adding the kind of things that makes it possible for &#8220;regular users&#8221; to get into it.
