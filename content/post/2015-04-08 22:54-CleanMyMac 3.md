CleanMyMac 3 is out. There are a lot of terrible &#8220;cleaning&#8221; utilities out there. CleanMyMac is the only good one I have found. I have used version 1, and are using version 2, and I will be upgrading to version 3 in a few days.



They have added some maintainance features, like permission repair, and extended the stuff they can clean.



CMM is a must for anyone with a small SSD. The price is $39.99, with %50 discount this week, and a permanent %50 off upgrade price.



Go and get it!
