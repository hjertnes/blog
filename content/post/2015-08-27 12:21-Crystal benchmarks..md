Crystal is a upcoming &#8220;content blocker&#8221; for iOS. The short version of the story is that Apple will allow developers to develop Safari extentions to block content, everything from ads to trackers etc on iOS 9. This will be very interesting. And this articles shows why.



I don&#8217;t mind non-intrusive ads. My problem is when I have to download tens upon tens of megabytes of javascript libararies and resources for tracking purposes on (almost) every single site I go to.
