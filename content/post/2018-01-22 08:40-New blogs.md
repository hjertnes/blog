title: "New blogs"

I started a daily [JavaScript][1] focused blog in November. Single topic blog posts, sometimes larger series of blog posts if the subject matter is big. Monday through Friday.



And I have also started to hang out over at [Micro.blog][2]. You can find me at <https://micro.blog/hjertnes> or [Hjertnes.social][3] or think Twitter, but driven by blogs and rss; with some nice Magic by Manton Reece to make it function more like a social network.
