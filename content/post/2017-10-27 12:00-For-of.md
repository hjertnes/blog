<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  For of is one of a few recent additions to the for loop in Javascript. It makes it possible to do what is basically a foreach in most other programming languages, like for example C#.<br /> <code>for(var item of array){}</code> is more or less the same as <code>foreach(var item in array){}</code> in C#.<br /> Why not just use .map or .forEach? Well, I usually do, but to do that can be a little bit cumbersome when you are dealing with async methods and async await, because then the arrow function in the .map also needs to be async etc.<br /> And it is nice to have an fast way to just loop through an array without having use a old school for loops. They are useful sometimes, and you should know how they work, but it is nice to have a quick and easy way to just loop thorugh an array.</p>
