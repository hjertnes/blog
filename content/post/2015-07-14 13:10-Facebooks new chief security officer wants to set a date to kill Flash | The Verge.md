Yes!



I have not had Flash installed outside the bundled version in Chrome since 2010; when I switched from Firefox to Chrome. And it isn&#8217;t that often I need flash for anything; maybe three or four times a month.



We need to phase it out. Because, the remianing flash content will only dissapair when they are forced to do so.
