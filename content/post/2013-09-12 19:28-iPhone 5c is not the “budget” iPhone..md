title: "iPhone 5c is not the “budget” iPhone."
---

I don&#8217;t really do that much news related commentary anymore. There is a lot of reasons for that, and it is something I plan on writing an article about at some point.



Let&#8217;s get back to the iPhone. I have not read a lot of stories about the iPhone event, or stories about the new phones in general. I skipped all the podcasts that was just talking about the iPhone event.



But. I have been listening to a few podcasts that was talking about the new phones. And I felt it was about time to write about this.



Many people was expecting a &#8220;budget&#8221; or &#8220;cheap&#8221; iPhone model. We did not get that. But we got a less expensive iPhone. That alone is boring, at least for me.



The thing I find very interesting is that Apple is treating the less expensive iPhone as the go to product, and the advanced and more powerful as something for the geeks and all the other people that want or need the power of the 5s.



There is nothing surprising or new about this. Apple is doing the same thing with their desktop computers. The iMac or Mac mini is the go to for most people, and a pretty low portion of it is buying the Mac Pro.



Let&#8217;s just hope that they don&#8217;t wait three years until the next &#8220;non c&#8221; iPhone model arrives.
