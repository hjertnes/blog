title: "Goodbye, Satoru Iwata | iMore"
---

**Peter Cohen:**



> Iwata was remarkable for a few reasons. He was the first boss of Nintendo who was not a member of the founding Yamauchi family. He was also only the fourth person to run the company, which got its start in the 19th century as a maker of hanafuda playing cards. Iwata was also not a career executive: He started out as a programmer, working for a Japanese video game developer called HAL Laboratory Inc. 



The world lost a giant.
