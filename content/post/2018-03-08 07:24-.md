As we move into this more and more divided world, where the moderate gets more and more ignored, and not just in politics I think we are missing something. 



I see a lot of people ignoring a simple details. And they are not dumb, just a little bit let's say "unreflected". 



People do things because they have reasons for doing them. As their horizon of understanding changes they chose differently than they used to.



This is the reason politicians and other leaders don't do what they said when they tried to get elected. 



You don't need to agree with the choices, or the reasons for doing something. But keep in mind that most people have reasons they do what they do. And very rarely they do something just to be evil or terrible.
