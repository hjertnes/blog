title: "My Favorite Entry"
---

> As I perused my journal to take stock of this year that was, I realized that of all the entries, the one that was my favorite was not an &#8220;entry&#8221; in the traditional sense at all. It is these delicate, small, pressed flowers. A tiny batch picked for me by my daughter Beatrix while we were on vacation in Madeline Island. These tiny flowers immediately transport me to a perfect day, in a lovely rented cottage, with a perfect view of Lake Superior. 



I love going through paper journals and notebooks, I always find something I had forgotten. Both words and drawings.
