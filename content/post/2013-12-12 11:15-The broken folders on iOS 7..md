title: "The broken folders on iOS 7."
---

I have tried, and I have tried; but I don&#8217;t like them â€“ at all. The thing I liked about the original folder design on iOS was that it was just an extension of the screen, no pages; just another 12 icons.



I know some people like that you know have the possibility to add many many many more items to any folder. And it might be useful for some people. But I don&#8217;t think so.



Here is the thing. The new folder design that Apple introduced with iOS7 have pages, with 9 icons on each page. And the whole thing just looks and behaves like a mini version of springboard. And the matter of fact is that it is both faster and easier to scroll through a few screens on my iPhone than it is to go into a folder.



I used to run a single homescreen setup in the iOS 6 days. I had 9 apps + the dock, and all folders on the bottom row. This setup worked like charm. The reason I used this system was to have the easiest way to locate and start apps.



Yes, I could combine all of those folders into one folder now. But it is just faster to browse through a few pages on springboard, than it is to browse through the 9 icon pages inside a folder.



It&#8217;s sad to see a simple, useful and great feature got his way. I don&#8217;t expect to see it go back. I haven&#8217;t used folders on any of my iOS devices in a few months. They are not useful anymore.
