Composition is a very important concept to understand if you are going to write good and maintainable react code. Because React components can be nested. What this means is that you can write a component where you say &#8220;place everything nested under me here&#8221;. You do this by using the children property.



You might have a component for the basic layout of your app, and then you place the router under it, telling it where you want the content to go.



This is a very powerful way to write re-usable code; where you want some to have the same stuff surrounding various different types of content.



Composition and Higher Order Components are the techniques I think are the reason you can write a lot more with a lot less lines of code using react; if you do it right.
