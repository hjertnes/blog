title: "iOS7; amazing new versions of apps I love."
---

Last night was the night; everyone else in the world got access to the new and shiny version of Apples iOS. I have been using it since the first developer preview.



I don&#8217;t want to waste your time on the OS itself; but I want to mention a few apps that I love, that have been reworked for iOS7.



  * Instacast

  * Instapaper

  * Byword

  * Left to spend



This is four very different apps, all of them was installed yesterday, and all of them are apps that I use almost every time I unlock my phone.



**[Instacast][1]** is my go to podcatcher – or podcast client. It have been for a long time, and I have written about it many times. The new look and feel is right; it&#8217;s iOS 7. It also brings some of the new background update features. I really look forward to spending some time and to get up to speed on all of the new features.



**[Instapaper][2]** is probably the app I have spent the most time in since I got my first iOS device. I really love it. The new release is just a UI update for the old app. So, my understanding is that it don&#8217;t include any new features. But, the new look is new, fresh but still familiar.



Both Instapaper and Instacast is apps that I have been using every day for so many years that it is close to impossible or at least very hard for me to change.



**[Byword][3]** is my go to writing app. I am in fact writing this blog post in Byword for mac. And I often do some editing, reviewing and even writing of blog posts on my iPhone. They did do a version 2.0 a few months back, and this release is more or less just a interface update to make it look good on iOS7.



I didn&#8217;t think the previous version looked any bad. Not at all. But, this release looks amazing.



**[Left to spend][4]** is not something I expect most people to know a lot about. But, it is a app I picked up on Patrick Rhone&#8217;s podcast [Enough][5]. It&#8217;s the only budget app that have ever worked for me.



You set a daily allowance, and then you just add any expense to the app. No labels or categories; just figure out how much money you can use every day, and just add every expense. Simple, elegant and brilliant.



I did not expect this app to be updated. I think the previous version of this app was from released when we went from iOS 3 to 4 or something like this. But, I really love that the developer updated it. Because, some of the functionality was broken and this is the kind of app I would have to develop myself if the developer did not step up and release an update to.



Like all the other&#8217;s, this app also released a full re-design. And like all the others, it looks amazing on iOS7.



**[Omni Focus 2 for iPhone][6]** is the easter egg. I don&#8217;t even know where to start.



First of all, the design looks amazing, but it is bold. I don&#8217;t think everyone will like it at first glance.



Second. The new app is cleaner better – and the inclusion of background sync is major – at least for me.



I have not used OF on iPhone at lot for the last six months. It have been major pain to have to wait for the database to sync each time I used the app. This was one of the reasons for moving stuff like my shopping list away from my phone and over to paper.



This update might solve this issue.



**Mach 2.** This, feels like the second coming of the App store. And I do think that many of my current iPhone apps, that is not updated to the new look at feel during the next few weeks, might find themselves replaced, very soon.
