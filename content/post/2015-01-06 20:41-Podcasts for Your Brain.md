title: "Podcasts for Your Brain"

Gabe of Macdrifter, writes a very interesting list of good podcasts. I have heard about some of them, but there was some new and interesting items. I write lists, and I don&#8217;t mind them, as long as they aren&#8217;t &#8220;clickbait&#8221;. A good and interesting list is good. They can be lazy or good; this one is very good.
