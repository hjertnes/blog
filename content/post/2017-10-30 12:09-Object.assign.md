<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  One very cumbersome operation in Javascript in the past, was the process of combining multiple objects. For example taking the output of multiple methods, combining them, before passing them on.<br /> There have been some good and some horrible and some less horrible ways to do this in the past. I used to either do it manually or to looping over objects, which wasn’t the most convenient thing in the world before ‘for in’.<br /> This is very easy to do with Object.assign.</p>

    The way it works is that you can give it any number of objects as arguments, and it combines it into a single object. And if a key exist in multiple of the inputs it will use the <strong>latest</strong>. As you can see in the example above. </div>
