I've started to bring Luna to the office, because reasons that aren't that important. She's not a huge fan of not being able to walk around as she wants and bothering who the hell she wants. But the first day went much better than expected. She was quiet most of the train rides and most of the time in the office. And she apparently hates the meeting room as much as I do.
