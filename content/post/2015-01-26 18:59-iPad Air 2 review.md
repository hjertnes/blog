title: "iPad Air 2 review"
---

> The iPad Air 2 took Apple&#8217;s thinnest and lightest full-sized tablet ever and made it even thinner and lighter. It also laminated the screen to make the pixels look like they were floating inside the glass, added Touch ID, and 8 megapixel iSight camera, and introduced the Apple A8X â€” a custom three processing core, eight graphics core chipset so powerful it made even recent ultrabooks nervous. But Apple themselves have told us technology alone isn&#8217;t enough. What matters is what we can do with it, where, and how well. Back in October we did a full iPad Air 2 review. Now we&#8217;re revisiting that review three months later. 



I love reviews that come, not the day after, not the week after, but either a few months after, or a year after. They are the ones that give me the best insight into how good the device really is.
