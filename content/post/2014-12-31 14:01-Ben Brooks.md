> I’ve written lists about X things that I learned in X years before, but those seem rather boring these days. I’ve not marked every birthday I’ve had on this site, but I felt like this was a good one to mark. Mostly because I’m finally at a numerical age which I like. ‘Thirty two’ rolls nicely off the tongue and that pleases me greatly.

    

> This year was a big one for me and it is marked by three major things I tried to achieve:

    

> 1. Being patient

    

> 2. Being kind

    

> 3. Finding a better job 



A good, simple and straight to the point retrospective.
