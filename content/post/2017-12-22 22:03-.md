I thought I would share this little tip right before the holidays. When I assume those of you that believe in New Years Resolutions are planning them.



When ever I know that I should do something about something that requires a lot of doing the same thing many times over. Like changing a lot of passwords or unsubscribing from newsletters etc, I often to this thing where I just add a repeating task for it. As a much more approachable and less procrastination prone way to do something about it.
