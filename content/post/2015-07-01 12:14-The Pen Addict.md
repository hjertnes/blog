That&#8217;s a lot of pens, I own six pens, but I never carry more than 3 or 4. And only 4 of the pens I own is in use.



  * Lamy 2000. This is my go to pen, I always use it, if the paper I am writing on is good enough. Everything from Field Notes to lecture notes, blog post drafts and journaling. 

  * Retro 51. This or the G2 below is the pen I use when I can&#8217;t use a fountain pen. Both of them are very good. 

  * Pilot G2 0.7.

  * Pilot Super Grip Medium Ball Point. This is the most acceptable pen I have found for something very specific. I need a ball point pen for when I&#8217;m working (fundraising) or when I take exams. Because I need something where I am forced to write hard enough for carbon paper to do its job. It isn&#8217;t fantastic, but it is better than the other ball points I have tried. And it lasts forever.
