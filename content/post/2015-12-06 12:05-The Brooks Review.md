**Ben Brooks:**



> But here’s the thing: WordPress just keeps working where as the other two I have been playing with keep breaking each time I update OS X. You see Apple loves to screw around with the PHP setup in OS X with each update, and typically I end up losing mcrypt when I update OS X. I’ve got it down to a science to get that back, but when it happens both Statamic and Grav go down — and I don’t just mean any back ends, I mean the entire sites go down — until I fix things. 



WordPress is the best solution to host your own dynamic CMS, I personally prefer Squarespace or Jekyll. The reason I prefer Jekyll when I host myself is because it runs as long as the web server can serve HTML files.
