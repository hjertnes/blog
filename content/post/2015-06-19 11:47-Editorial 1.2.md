title: "Editorial 1.2"
---

I have been a Editorial users since the app came out, first on iPad, and then on iPhone one year later.



Editorial is a really powerful app, and you can make it do more or less everything, but you don&#8217;t need to install any workflows to have a very good iOS text editor.



I love the fact that you can use it for almost everything, and that I can use it for what I need at the moment out of the box: Dropbox plain text notes, and task paper files.



And I love the slow update cycle, it is once a year. Which is slow, but the app is so solid. I have never met any problem with it.



Check out [Macdrifter&#8217;s][1] or [Viticci&#8217;s][2] post to see what the 1.2 update brings; I would check out both.
