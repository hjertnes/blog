**Stephen Hackett:**



> OS X El Capitan looks like a Snow Leopard moment for the Mac. There&#8217;s good stuff in 10.11 — and I&#8217;ll be reviewing it again this year — but for the average user, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a ton to get worked up about. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a problem, however. Some stability and some breathing room will be welcomed by many. 



I can&#8217;t wait for the public beta.
