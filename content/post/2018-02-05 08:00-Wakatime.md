I discovered [Wakatime][1] a while back. I&#8217;m probably a little bit late to the party on this. But a lot of people I have talked to wasn&#8217;t aware of it.



Wakatime is a time tracking system made to track how much time you spend in your text editor or text editors of Choice.



The way it works is that you install a python program that does the actual tracking, and add plugins to the editors you use. And then it will do its best to send in how much time you spend coding on what project, using what editor programming in what language.



I don&#8217;t think it is the best tool to use for billing and stuff like that. But I think it is a excellent tool to get an idea of how much time you spend doing this very specific type of work, and on what projects and languages you spend your time on.
