title: "Camera bags are hard."
---

I have owned many camera bags, and I have not been very happy with any of them. 

If you are looking for one bag to fit every single use case, you'll probably be unhappy with it most of the time.  Look at the gear you have, and the situations where you might need to bring it somewhere. For example If I'm not just taking my camera as is without anything extra I'm either bringing my X-Pro and some primes or my X-Pro with one lens and my Nikon FM with one lens and some batteries and rolls of 35mm film. 

So I decided to have one bag that is great for just carrying two cameras and one backpack that is awesome for when I travel. Also try to find a bag that is designed the the kind of camera you have. Because one designed for full frame cameras will be huge and bulky and overkill if you just carry some small mirrorless system. 

I personally go with cheaper bags, and try to have a good one for each situation. Instead of one expensive bag. Like I mentioned above, when I try to solve it all with one bag I always end up with some kind of compromise I never want to use for anything.
