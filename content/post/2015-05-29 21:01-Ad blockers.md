title: "Ad blockers"
---

I think Ad blockers should be legal. The problem isn&#8217;t ad blockers, the problem is bad ads. No, not bad â€“ terrible.



The problem is not ads themselves, but the fact that they drive users to install ad blockers. We get free stuff, and the ads are paying for that. Fine. That&#8217;s the deal. But ad companies and site owners need to get better at creating the kind of ad campaigns that don&#8217;t drive us nuts. The kind where you want to click on the ad.
