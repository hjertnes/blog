title: "Battery Hell"
---

The first thing I do when I get into the office in the morning is to plug in my iPhone and my Apple Watch. Because I use the latter to monitor my sleep, and the former as a alarm clock; and then I start to charge my AirPods. First the right, then the left. And when my iPhone is fully charged I charge my case, before I plug in my iPhone again and leave it like that until I leave for the day. 

I really hope that the charging pad thingies take off soon. Because all of this battery crap have started to get kind of annoying. There are so many things I use every single day that needs charging. 

My AirPods, iPhone, Watch, Laptops, Nintendo Switch, power banks etc. It would be great if some of it could be solved by just placing it on a charging area. It doesn't need to be fast, but it should not require you to place it at a exact place, and it should support many devices.
