title: Learning Clojure could make you a better Java or C# programmer.
---


When you get into Clojure, you get really good at doing some stuff. Like for example writing small functions that do one thing really well in as little code as possilble, while still being robust. A part of this means that the function itself is made to be used together with other functions.

I think this will make you a better programmer in any langage. Because you kind of learn or get into the act of just writing a lot of small functions that you use all over. Instead of writing the same stuff over and over.

That is the first way where you become a better programmer. The other is about data. Once you get into the idea that data is not something that is changed, it could become something you use a lot in any language to avoid weird bugs. It is a lot easier to write immutable code with Clojure than other languages, because their api have been made to do just that. But you can still do a lot to move in that direction in most good languages (I'm looking at you Python).
