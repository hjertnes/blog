title: "Sunlit 1.2 & App.net"
---

Maton Reece just announced that [Sunlit 1.2][1] is available in the App Store.



I haven&#8217;t commented on the App.net happenings yet. Not because I didn&#8217;t have anything to say, but mainly because a lot of other people said more or less what I was thinking.



But there is one thing I would like to say. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll spend much time on App.net as a social network. But I would pay for App.net if there was more apps like Sunlit out there.



Let me explain. I would pay $3 a month(or whatever what it is) if there was more apps(that I&#8217;m interested in) that used it as their sync platform.



I hope that App.net survives. And I might even renew my subscription if I end up using Sunlit more than I do today.



Sunlit is basically like DayOne for sharing photos with your friends and family. In other words a combination of a journal and a photo gallery.
