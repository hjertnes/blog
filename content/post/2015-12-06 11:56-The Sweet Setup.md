**The Sweet Setup:**



> Of all the cases we put to the test, Appleâ€™s own Silicone Case provided the best combination of form, function, and ease of use. 



I got a red Apple silicone case together with my 6s Plus, and it is a fantastic case. It is a great case, and the best case I have used with any iPhone. My only issue is it is a pain to get it in and out of the pocket in my jeans.
