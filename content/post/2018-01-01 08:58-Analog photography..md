title: "Analog photography."

I have written about analog photography a lot. And I will probably continue to do so.



Some people love it, other people hate it. And some people have the same kind of feelings about digital photography.



I love both. The fast iteration of digital makes it possible to learn a shit load in just a single weekend. While bare minimum of analog photography makes it very enjoyable. But I believe that everyone will become much better photographers if they spend time shooting with a fully manual camera. Without anything but a meter. All of us understand how the various settings of our camera affects each other. But you will understand it much better, when you have to do it all yourself.



You need to shoot in manual, if you want to master exposure. One option is to set your digital camera to manual. But I thought it was much easier to do it with a analog camera from the late 70s. Because it is designed for shooting this way, while the only modern cameras that are designed for this come from Leica and Fuji. And because you don&#8217;t have the option of turning stuff back on.



You will understand what auto focusing and your camera meter are doing. And you will realize that the exposure doesn&#8217;t need to be spot on. Same goes for focusing; unless you&#8217;re shooting wide open.



I think shooting analog have had a bigger impact on my photography than most of the books I&#8217;ve read.
