title: "Show up!"
---

There are a lot of different advice around the internet about writing a blog, doing a podcast and almost any other kind of content creating. Oh man, I hate that work. But, I couldn&#8217;t find something better.



My personal opinion and experience about creating content is that you should put all the effort into showing up on a consistent schedule.



The most important part is to show up and do the work. Write once a week, or every day. But make sure to do it in a consistent manner. And the other part is about evolving. You don&#8217;t start out as a John Gruber or a Shawn Blanc. But try to always create content you are proud of.



Show up, and create something awesome.
