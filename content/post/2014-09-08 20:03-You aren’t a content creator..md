title: "You arenâ€™t a content creator."
---

I don&#8217;t like imprecise descriptions, or definitions. And I hate passive writing even more. The thing that fascinate me more than anything is that people think they are content creator. What is a creator? A creator and the creator is two very different things. What is content? Well, content is more or less anything.



This bullshit need to stop, right now.



You are a writer, you are a podcaster, you are a photographer you are a &#8220;whatever the people creating video&#8217;s for youtube are called&#8221;.



Be precise. Tell people what you do. Don&#8217;t use generic terms. A content creator could be everything from sending dick picks over snapchat to writing a very popular site.
