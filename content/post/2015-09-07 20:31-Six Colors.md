> For me it’s a milestone in a few other ways, too. This week marks a year since I left IDG, and it’s also week 52 of the existence of this site. Next week will be the first anniversary of Six Colors. 



Six Colors is a great site, and it have been so from day one. And I think I speak for most long time Apple Geeks when I say that it was fantastic to see Jason writing again.
