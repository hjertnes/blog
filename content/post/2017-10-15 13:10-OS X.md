    There are a few tasks I have to break down into small chunks. One of them are maintaining the “Audit” section of 1Password, another one is to manage Notifications on OS X.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    The short version is: I don’t want any.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    So. The way you disable notifications on OS X, is more or less the same as iOS. You have to you through every singe app and disable everything. And it is a major pain in the ass.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    My problem with it is two fold. First of all, why not let me mark all of them and do what ever I want to do with either all or any selection of apps. Second, why do I have to click a million different things to just disable notifications?

  </p>

    This is one of the areas where the iOS influence on OS X was wrong. Not the inclusion of it, but rather that the interface are lacking every ability to work efficient.
