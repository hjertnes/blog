Soulver have become one of my all time favourite apps. I use it for almost everything related to numbers, on iOS and OS X. I think I first heard about it from [Marco][1]. I think he mentioned it on the episode of MacPowerUsers he was on, and various times on Build and Analyse<sup id="fnref-0"><a href="#fn-0" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.



Soulver is in many ways what spreadsheets should be. It lets you work with numbers and related operations in text. I use it for all kinds of different things. I store close to everything in my PlainText folder. Everything from keeping track of how many hours I have spent on the different jobs I have, to everything else I need to remember. The great thing about Soulver is that I can just paste a file in the current format

The big issue with this system is how to calculate the total. I could do it by hand, but it might be 10 rows, or 100. So I just paste the content into Soulver and it tells me what the total is. It&#8217;s great.



Check out their [website][2] for more information about Soulver. And all the cool stuff it can do.
