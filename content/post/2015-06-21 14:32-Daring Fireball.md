DuckDuckGo have gone a very long way the last 12 months. I think there are two reasons for it: Apple have made DuckDuckGo a option on OS X and iOS, and a lot of geeks, bloggers and podcasters have switched over to DuckDuckGo, from Google since OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 was released.



The next step is of cource to see DuckDuckGo as the default search engine in browsers and operating systems.
