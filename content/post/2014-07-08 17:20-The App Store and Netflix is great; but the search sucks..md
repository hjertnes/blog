title: "The App Store and Netflix is great; but the search sucks."
---

My mother have never owned any computer except for her iPad and iPhone. And she never downloads anything, except for the apps that I have installed on them.



She got a new TV last year. And my step father was browsing netflix on it, during christmas, looking for something all of us could watch. And I realised the major problem with Netflix for my parents generation; in particular the part of them that aren&#8217;t computer savvy.



We couldn&#8217;t find anything. All of us wanted to watch. I would just pick some random movie, and watch ten minutes, to figure out if I wanted to watch more of it, and do that until I found something interesting.



What I wish Netflix had is some IMDB integration, combined with some Pandora like features.



Here is what I want. Let&#8217;s say my mother likes Titanic. You search or pick that movie in Netflix, they look at meta-data about that movie, and you get a list of similar movies in the netflix catalogue, sorted by rating.



The problem with both the app store and netflix for non-geeks or non-computer savvy people is that there are no good way to find what you want.



On the app store side, I want some way for developers to check off some standard features that the app has. Like for example: I want a markdown editor, with built-in browser that syncs with Dropbox.



It would be really hard for me to find that with a search in the app store.
