title: "Why and why not Google â€“ All this"
---

I have been moving stuff away from google for a very long time. It all started when I got fed up with Google Docs and Gmail. And it looks like 2015 was the year when geeks started to move away from Google Search.



There are reasons to use Google, and there are reasons to not use Google.



Ads are a part of the internet, and I don&#8217;t expect to get away from them ever, but I try to limit how much each company know about me. This means: I use Google only where they are the best, or don&#8217;t have any close competitors.



I do the same with Facebook; I only use it when I have to.
