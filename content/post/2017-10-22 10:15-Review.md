    This have been a tool in my belt for a very long time. <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid App</a> is the fastest and easiest way to turn a Web Site into a App on OS X.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Why would you do that?

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Well, I personally prefer to have som web apps as a separate window outside my browser, because I don’t want it to disappear between all of the way too many tabs I have open, and because some of them are in use all of the time.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    It’s only five bucks. And is well worth the money.

    I use Fluid, even though I cloud fire up Xcode and do the same thing there. But why would I spend like an hour or something to get it to work right, when I could spend a few minutes doing it in fluid?
