The typical post WWDC journalism is here. And I&#8217;m already sick of it.



Every year at this time, when all the journalists and reporters are getting down from the &#8220;Everything Apple annonced&#8221;-high. Then they start talking about all of the major and minor things that Apple didn&#8217;t improve.



Here is the thing. Apple can&#8217;t do everything. And I prefer an Apple that gives us a handfull of solid improvements, or something in that ballpark. To an Apple that gives us a boatload of buggy, and far from perfect stuff.



This is Apple, not Google. Deal with it.
