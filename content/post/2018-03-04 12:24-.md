I've been looking for a good replacement for Django for a while. What I like about Django is that you get everything you need to build a database backed backend out of the box. What I don't like is how bad of a fit Python is for functional programming, and because the type system isn't that great. 



Clojure seems like the best option I've tested out this far.
