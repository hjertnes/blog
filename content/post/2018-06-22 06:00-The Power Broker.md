The Power Broker is one of my all time favourite books. It is very long, but still a fantastic read. I have dragged myself through the audio book three or four times. And I love it. 

What makes a biography a good biography is that the person it is about is interesting but also that the author presents good and the bad sides of a person and manages to tie them together. 

Robert Carro does this masterfully in The Power Broker. 

Here is the thing, there are sides regarding Robert Moses that I hate, while at the same time I respect a lot of what he was trying to do and appreciate how much he did get done and how much power he managed to build up. 

It's weird to sit here without being able to say if I like him or hate him or anything between.
