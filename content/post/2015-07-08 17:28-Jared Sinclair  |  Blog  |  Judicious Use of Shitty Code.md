**Jared Sinclair:**



> Not all shitty code is equal. There’s such a thing as judicious use of shitty code. Your app shouldn’t crash, so don’t try to be clever. Don’t assume that a web service will always give you the values you expect. Don’t assume that some index is within the length of an array. Don’t pass an NSManagedObject between threads. Some corners shouldn’t be cut. 



This is interesting.



There are many good reasons for writing clean code: easier to maintain, better, easier to understand more future proof etc. But there is a difference between writing unclean code, and being stupid. You can create a good app with the first one, but not with the last one.
