Jordan Cooper was a guest on the last [episode][1] of Systematic. And he checked out his podcast called [Tech Douchebags][2]. This isn&#8217;t just the funniest comedy podcast I have found in a very long time. But, it&#8217;s also the best combination between tech and comedy I have ever heard.



Check it out if you are a geek that don&#8217;t like &#8220;normal&#8221; people that use tech wrong.
