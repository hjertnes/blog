title: "Hands-on with the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard | Macworld"
---

**Jason Snell, writing for Macworld:**



> Would I want to write a novel on the Smart Keyboard or the iPad Pro’s touchscreen keyboard? No, I suppose I wouldn’t. But I’m pretty sure that I could absolutely do so with the Smart Keyboard–and I’d certainly benefit from having a physical keyboard with me all the time, not just when I had the time and inclination to tote along an external Bluetooth keyboard. 



That&#8217;s good enough for me.
