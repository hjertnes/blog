Finally, Editorial for iPhone launched a few days ago. There are a number of reasons that I&#8217;m really excited about this. First of all, I loved the iPad app, but I didn&#8217;t use it much. Because I don&#8217;t use my iPad that much. Secondly, the app includes native TaskPaper support. Which is awesome.



But the thing I love the most about Editorial is that I can extend it to my needs using python and the built in workflow engine.



Editorial have replaced a number of apps on my phone during the last few days. First it replaced Notesy as my go to notes app. And of course it replaced Byword as my go to app for writing drafts for blog posts(I still use Byword on OS X, though). Then I realised that I could get rid of Pythonista, and just use Editorial for all of the stuff I did there. And finally, it also replaced Taskmator as my TaskPaper client.



I think this is the first time one single app manages to replace four apps, in a way that makes the whole experience way better.



Go and get [Editorial][1] if you want, what I think is the best text editor for iOS.
