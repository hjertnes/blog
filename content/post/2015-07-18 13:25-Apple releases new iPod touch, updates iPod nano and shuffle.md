Great to see some new iPod&#8217;s. The Nano and Shuffle models are great if you want a simple device to use while working out. And it is fantastic to see a new iPod Touch model, it is a great device for testing beta&#8217;s, giving to kids or and for developers that need to test compability on multiple versions of iOS.
