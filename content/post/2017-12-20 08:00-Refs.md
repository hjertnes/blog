Refs are a way you can do something with your child component. For example like in the example below:

Like you see in the example, I have made a method on the child component for changing the background color on the button, and I&#8217;d like to call that from the parent component. The way you do that is to give the component a ref as a prop. That will add it to the this.refs object, and give you the ability to call methods on the component. It can be very useful if you for example have a component with multiple sections of form values as seperate components and would like to have a Save all button in the root component.



Refs are useful when you need them, but I personally look at them as a &#8220;last resort&#8221;. I think that component should be as independent as possible; the parent should only know that &#8220;there are stuff here&#8221; and not too much about the different logic inside children. But again, they are very useful when you need it.
