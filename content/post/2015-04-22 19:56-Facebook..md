Facebook used to have just one mobile app, one on iOS and a similar one on Android. Then they bought a company, and suddenly they had two, one regular app, and a Messenger app. Some people love it, while others hate it.



I think Facebook&#8217;s Messenger platform is one of the best messenging platforms out there, especially now that we have a web-version of it, for laptops and desktops.



The number one complaint about Facebook app is that they removed the messenging functionallity from their app. I think it was a great move, just because the messaging functionallity in their regular app was so terrible. It was never good.



I&#8217;m a weird Facebook user, I use the Messanger app a lot, but I don&#8217;t use Facebook itself for much.



Facebook is a platform, and Messanger is also a platform; and Facebook need to innovate in both to keep growing. It seems like a new version of what we called IM 17 years ago, and IRC before that is the &#8220;hot&#8221; thing at the moment.



We don&#8217;t really do much new, it&#8217;s just a new version of something old. Or like a lot of people summarize the history of philosophy: it&#8217;s just a bunch of footnotes to Plato.
