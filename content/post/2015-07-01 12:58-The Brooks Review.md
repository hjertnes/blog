**Ben Brooks:**



> I hadn’t touched my contexts inside of OmniFocus in, well, years. There was a ton of cruft in there stemming from various different techniques and ideas that I have tried over the years. Device based context, person based context, time based contexts, and location based contexts. For the better part of a year, all of my new tasks in OmniFocus simply went under the Mac context and — well — that’s not really using the tool very well.

    

> But I struggled, because dicking around with my contexts is not productive, is tedious, and frankly it is quite annoying. More than any of that: I didn’t have a single idea of what to change it to.
