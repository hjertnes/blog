title: "Writing in the Squarespace web-interface."
---

I put a task called &#8220;Write something in the Squarespace web-interface&#8221; in TaskPaper a few days ago, when I realised that I&#8217;ve never actually written anything here. I usually just write in Byword and copy-page it into the web-interface.



The experience of doing this might have been a little bit better if I had tried this a few days ago. Because Squarespace just released a new version of their block-system today. There are a few things about that I don&#8217;t like.



I have to double click to be able to insert text, this used to be a single click. And secondly, I can&#8217;t get a fullscreen input field to write in. I get this pop-over in the fullscreen mode.



First of all, this interface is no worse, and no better than what WordPress or Tumblr provides from a writing perspective. The block system is however much better from a layout, and everything else perspective.



I think I will go back to writing in Byword; I will however check back later to see if they make any changes to make this a better experience.



One final note. It seems like I can&#8217;t run the spelling control in this input field. **Big minus**.
