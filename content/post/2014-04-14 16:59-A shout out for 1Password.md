This is the situation, [Heartbleed][1] is the latest in security issues. It&#8217;s a bug in OpenSSL, the library most security related technologies use these days. Everything from sites running over SSL, to VPN and regular file encryption.



I&#8217;m not too scared, I&#8217;m not.



Here is the reason.



_I use 1Password._



I store most of the sites I have visited since 2011, in 1Password. And I can just create a smart folder, and start changing every single password in there when I need to.



It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not scared that people will steal my passwords and break in. The thing is that I know that my passwords are unique, and that it&#8217;s not a huge hassle to change them.



So, if you haven&#8217;t purchased [1Password][2] yet – do it – today.
