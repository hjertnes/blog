PropTypes is one of the things you should get into the habit of doing sooner rather than later, kind of like keys, because it is harder to get into the habit the longer you wait. Proptypes is a way to define what kind of props you expect your components to get, what type they have and which of them are required.



It is an easy way, when you get it setup, to detect a lot of mistakes and stupid bugs.



For example:

If you look at the example above, it will show you how the two core selling points of PropTypes. The &#8220;children&#8221; prop is defined as a list and is required, this means that you will get a error if you try to use it without that props; while the defaultProps part lets you define default values. Which means the component will use the value &#8220;World&#8221; if you don&#8217;t specify it.



I think proptypes are awesome, and they are good for avoiding dumb mistakes, documenting your component and far more elegant than other ways of &#8220;defining&#8221; default values
