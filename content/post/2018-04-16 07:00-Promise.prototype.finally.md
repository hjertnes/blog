We finally have a finally method on promises. 



Previously we had the .then and .catch methods on promises, you deal with a success in the .then and errors in .catch. But often you have some code you want to run no matter if it is a success or not. Finally solves this exact problem. For example if you want to hide a loading UI element or something no matter if it was a success or not.
