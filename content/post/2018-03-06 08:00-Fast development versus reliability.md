title: "Fast development versus reliability"
---

When you choose what programming languages to use for your project you should take in to consideration if developer productivity or reliability is more important.



For example if I develop the backend in Python and Django I&#8217;m much more productive, but if I use a programming language such as Java or C# I get a much stronger type system, which are catching more potential problems during compile time (if you are using it correct).



Having a strong type system can help you a lot, which means that it helps you to make sure that you don&#8217;t add a number to a string variable. But that means that you need to use more time declaring what type a variable has. But on the other side you often have to add more code to make sure that your data structures have the correct content in dynamic languages like Python.



And having a strong type system is also very helpful when you refactor code.



On the other hand, languages like Python often requires far less code than C# does.



It doesn&#8217;t matter that much on the end result, but my experience is that having solid automated tests are very important when you use dynamic languages. And I think there are something very comforting about letting the compiler doing the first round of validation.



This is by the way one of the big advantages of using Swift instead of Objective C.
