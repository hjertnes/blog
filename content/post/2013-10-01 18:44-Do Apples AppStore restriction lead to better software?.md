title: "Do Apples AppStore restriction lead to better software?"
---

This is one of the questions I have been asking myself for a very long time. One side of me, the hacker want to be able to do all of the crazy stuff I have on my mac. Like Alfred. Or to just run a simple script to rename all .txt files in my [nvalt] folder to .md. But on the other side, do I really need this?



I have been aware of both [Editorial] and [Pythonista] for quite a while. I knew everyone I respect on the internet(or at least most of them) love it. I knew I should give it a try. But, like most apps, it takes some time before I get around to do something about it. And after spending a half hour reading @viticci&#8217;s [book] about it, and maybe ten minutes in the editor itself(including writing this article) I realised how awesome it is. **I want this on my mac**.



But, back to the main topic. Does the App store restrictions lead to better software? I&#8217;ve had this teory for quite some time. For one, unlike on OS X, you cant do what ever you want to on iOS. One part of it is the hardware and software restrictions themselves, while others are restrictions that Apple have put in place to make the experience of the device as a whole better.



The other part of it is the security aspect. We know that there have not been many &#8220;malware&#8221; apps, in the iOS app store. This is one of the great thing about the sandboxing thing. We know that each app have to be tested by apple, and that it is only allowed to mess around with their own files.



Lets say if Rdio have a bug that deletes everything; well this means you have to re-sync your music and maybee re-create your playlists. Buts thats it. You would never know what kind of implications that would have if you had the same issue with a OS X application.



But, back to my point. I think App Store restrictions not just will, but is leading us to better software. Editorial is a prime example of this. For one they are leading to better solutions for handling issues we did in the simplest way possible before.â€¨ There is just one important thing here. Apple have to get better at giving developers more tools for handling their current issues; like for example inter-app communication. But, dont give what we ask for, give us what we really need.
