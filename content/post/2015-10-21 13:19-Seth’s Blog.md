> As of now, there are more minutes produced by the podcasts I listen to each day than there is time to listen to them. 



I have met the podcast surplus many times over my life, and how many I listen to go up and down, depending on, well my life. Podcasts is my current favourite entertainment, and it isn&#8217;t a problem with a long backlog, as long as the majority of the podcasts isn&#8217;t something that goes out of date(news); there is always a situation where you are going to complete it. And the same thing applies to Instapaper queue.
