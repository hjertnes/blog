Webpack is your compiler, and learning how to use that tools shouldn&#8217;t be the first thing you do, because a lot of people will probably give up before they get started. I think that most experienced developers should understand what the webpack configuration does. And all teams should have at least one person that can wrangle together a config file from scratch.



I say, start with create-react-app, then learn how to write react code, and then learn how webpack works when you have a thing you need to do that create-react-app can&#8217;t do.



It isn&#8217;t that complicated really. You have a entry point (the javascript file where webpack will begin) some configuration of how you want to transform your code, some configuration of how the output should be and that&#8217;s it. The great thing about using something like webpack is that you can build everything from your javascript code, and styling plus generating HTML files (both for development and production). You can for example add a hash to the file names to avoid caching problems in production.



I typically start with create-react app these days, and then move on to using my own webpack, if or when I need to.
