    There are times where you need and want something full featured with a user firendly authentication and registration system, and there are other times you just want to put a resource behind some kind of authentication system.

    <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/basic-auth-sample">THis</a> Express project does the latter. It let&#8217;s you define username and passord as enviornment variables and are using the built in support for HTTP Basic Auth in your browser to manage it.

    I think it is the perfect option for simple tools that aren&#8217;t intended to be used by anyone outside your org. For example for backend or monitoring systems.
