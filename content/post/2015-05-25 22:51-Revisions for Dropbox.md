title: "Revisions for Dropbox"

> I was excited to discover Revisions For Dropbox, a Mac app for viewing a history of changes for any file or folder in your Dropbox account. I&#8217;d been looking for precisely this solution, and it didn&#8217;t disappoint. 



Looks great, especially for people that need to recover old versions of files. I used to do it all the time between 2010 and 2013. Great app, and I&#8217;ll be checking it out the next time I have to revert to an old version.
