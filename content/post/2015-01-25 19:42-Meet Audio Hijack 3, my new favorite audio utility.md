title: "Meet Audio Hijack 3, my new favorite audio utility"
---

**Six colors:**



> Rogue Amoeba has announced the release of Audio Hijack 3, the successor to the venerable Mac sound utility Audio Hijack Pro. This is a huge update—the first major one for Audio Hijack in ten years—and so comprehensive that this feels more like a successor to the old Audio Hijack rather than a continuation. 



It looks like magic.
