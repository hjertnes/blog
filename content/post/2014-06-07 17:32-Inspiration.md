title: "Inspiration"

Great writers read a lot, is a famous quote. And it&#8217;s also one of the greatest lessons for any aspiring writer. But. That&#8217;s not everything.



One of my sources of inspiration during the last year and a half have been podcasts.



I think one of my strengths as a writer and creative is to pick up simple ideas and write about them.



I&#8217;m not the kind of writer that sit and stare at a empty document. I just get an idea, and then I write. Like Ernest Hemingway once said:



> There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed. 



All I need is a simple idea and something to write on; a phone, tablet, computer, notebook or even a napkin. And then I just write what&#8217;s inside my head. Often just my inner monologue. Edited for the public. Mainly to make it understandable for other people than me. But I never edit the content.
