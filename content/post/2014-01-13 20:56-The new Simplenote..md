title: "The new Simplenote."

I have been playing around with Simplenote tonight, it’s very cool!



It’s been a long time since the last time I used Simplenote, it was around the time when everyone moved from using Simplenote as their go to sync service for their nvALT database, to Dropbox.



They now have apps for: &#8211; OS X &#8211; iOS &#8211; Web &#8211; Android / Kindle



I have played around with all except for the Android version, and they are pretty great. The thing I really like about them is that the whole experience and design is close to identical on all platforms; at least as much as they should be.



Why did I do this? Just for fun.



I’m going to write a longer post on all of the different apps I use for writing on various devices after I’m done with another large post, I’m working on.



One of the key reasons I started playing around with Simplenote was to have a good, simple plain text note solution that I could point non-geeks to. And simplenote is just that. I can’t tell them to download nvALT, change various settings there, install dropbox and then to install Notesy on their phone. That would be too much. But I could tell them to just install Simplenote everywhere.



I was a bit sceptical, but the fact that they have a export tool that can export everything you put into Simplenote – including tags, got be to at least give it a chance.



What’s to pro and cons here?



**Pro:** &#8211; Beautiful and well designed apps &#8211; Very fast sync &#8211; Simple. &#8211; Tags. The tagging support in the sync, and how it is implemented in the apps is very cool!



**Con:** &#8211; The search is not as fast, as what you find in nvALT &#8211; No Markdown support. &#8211; Less third party apps. &#8211; The sync converts spaces to tabs. **Don’t put your TaskPaper files into Simplenote!**. &#8211; No premium accounts available at the moment…
