title: "The Fuji X100T &mdash; Tools and Toys"
---

I have been looking for a good &#8220;compact camera&#8221; for a while, and the X100T have been on the top of my list for a few weeks now. This is not the camera that will replace most DSLR or MFT cameras, but it is the first really small camera I&#8217;m excited about.



Yes, I&#8217;m probably going to buy one of them after the summer.
