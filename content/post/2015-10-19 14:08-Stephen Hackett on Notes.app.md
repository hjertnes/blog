title: "Stephen Hackett on Notes.app"
---

Stephen Hackett have written two posts about the new Notes.app: [Notes on Notes.app][1] and [Notes.app follow-up][2].



I think the new Notes.app is a giant step in the right direction, and Evernote need the competition to make sure that they make their app good again. But I&#8217;m sticking with my current nvALT setup for a while, at least until I see the thing Brett Terpstra is working on to replace it. This is why:



  * Dropbox sync is in my experience faster and more stable than iCloud; and I&#8217;m more confident in how to manage conflicts etc there. 

  * I have other ways to deal with the extra stuff Notes.app brings to the table, like for example TaskPaper. 

  * At least 90% of my notes are just a lot or a little text, nvALT and iOS text editors are way better at searching for and managing that than the notes app; and I love Markdown. 

  * I don&#8217;t want something that is as important as my notes to be on a yearly update cycle.
