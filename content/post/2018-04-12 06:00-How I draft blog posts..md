title: "How I draft blog posts."
---

I draft more or less every single blog post on paper. Usually using a pencil or a fountain pen. Then I write it into MarsEdit and publish them. Or usually schedule them for publishing later. 

I'm not a careful editor. But I often do a full re-write when I'm not happy with it. The process of first writing it on paper and then re-writing them is a exercise I enjoy, because then I can use the paper draft to figure out what I want to say, before I re-write it into something much shorter and more concise.
