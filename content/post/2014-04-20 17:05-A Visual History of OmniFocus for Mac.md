title: "A Visual History of OmniFocus for Mac"

Shawn Blanc wrote a great [post][1] about visual history of OmniFocus; from kGTD to OmniFocus. The interesting part here is how similar the kGTD, and the 1.0 version is to the current version of OmniFocus.



I think OF version 2 will be great. It will be the first major re-design of the app, since before it existed<sup id="fnref-0"><a href="#fn-0" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.

  kGTD was a set of AppleScripts for Omnioutliner, that let you use it as a GTD system. And most people look at it as the predecessor to OmniFocus.&#160;<a href="#fnref-0">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
