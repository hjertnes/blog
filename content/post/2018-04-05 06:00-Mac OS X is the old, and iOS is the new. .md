title: "Mac OS X is the old, and iOS is the new. "
---

I often see people saying "X is solved with Y on OS X, I hope Apple will support it", and I'm pretty sure that it won't happen at this point. There might show up something like Y that solves it, but it will not me the same. And probably not as flexible.

That's just how it will be.

iOS is not the kind of computing I enjoy. And I will hopefully be able to work on a UNIX system or a UNIX like system for a very long time. But it is not the future.
