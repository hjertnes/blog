  <p>

    I think I first started using <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> when I discovered when the OS X App Store launched.. And I have had it running on all of my Macs since then.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    Moom is the only window manager for OS X that have made much sense to me. It combines the simple, with the powerful.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    When you install Moom, you get a hover menu when you place your mouse over the green window control button on any given window. You know the button that puts an app in full screen. It will let you resize that window to fill the whole screen, or resize and move it to fill half the screen in four different combos (left half, right half, top half, button half). This is very easy to do, and very power ful and it would require a lot of messing around to do it manually, many times.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    You can also create your own, and attach them to that menu or assign keyboard shortcuts. Or even create a snapshot of a specific layout.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    The way I use it the most, is when I connect my 27” 4K monitor at work. Because then I want to have four apps on each virtual desktop. One in each corner.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    The way I do it is that I laugh four apps; Visual Studio Code, iTerm, Google Chrome and Tweetbot. For the first one. Option Control Space to trigger the Moom shortcut and then 1 to move an app to the top left corner, 2 to move an app to top right, 3 top bottom left and 4 to bottom right.

  </p>

  

  <p>

    It usually takes me five minutes to launch and move stuff around to be ready to start working. And that includes the time the various apps need to launch. I don’t even want to thin about how much it would take me manually.
