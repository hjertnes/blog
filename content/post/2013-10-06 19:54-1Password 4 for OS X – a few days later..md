title: "1Password 4 for OS X â€“ a few days later."

I wrote about 1Password 4, before the weekend, and thought I might want to revisit it after spending some real time with the application. And not just the 20 minutes, right before I wrote the piece.



There is two features in this release I really love: the audit section, and the menubar version of the application.



**Audit**. What the audit section is doing for you, is to tell you all of the password you should change. I really love this. Like I wrote in my previous post; you could do it with smart folders. But, I think a lot more people is going to use this. Because, its right there. It takes you one click to see all your weak passwords. Or three clicks to get an overview of passwords that have not been changed in everything from six months to over three years.



You also have a dupicate section. This will display every account where you use the same password as somewhere else. This might not look that big. But, trust me &#8211; it is. It was a major pain in the ass to do this with version three. You had to configure every different password you used as a &#8220;standard&#8221; as a smart folder.



**Menubar.** I did not expect to use this one that much. But, I was wrong. Most of the times when I start 1Password, it is to just copy some password to somewhere outside the browser. And its amazing to be able to do this from the menubar.



Its one of these productivity hacks, where three clicks becomes one.



And still, 1Password 4 is a solid upgrade, and everyone should upgrade as soon as they can afford to.
