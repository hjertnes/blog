title: "Advertisements."
---

This is a collection of my thoughts about ads, and especially ads on the web. I don&#8217;t think they are nearly as offensive as billboards and ad&#8217;s in the real world.



Here is the thing, a huge amount of the people that create stuff on the internet rely on ads as their income. Some make videos on YouTube, other people have blogs or podcasts – most of them have ads.



I don&#8217;t skip ads on podcasts, and I don&#8217;t use ad blockers.



I get something for free – or I&#8217;m not paying for something. And therefore I&#8217;m the product they use for getting paid for their work. That&#8217;s a fair deal.



There is however one important detail.



Some people use Ad Networks like Google to provide ads, and just show anything or anyone that are willing to pay for it. While others seek to have something tailored for their audience.



I never click on any generic Google or Facebook ad. I have never done it. And I seriously doubt I will ever do it. Ever.



But I do often click on ads on blogs, or go to the sponsors of podcasts, because they are of interest for me. Blogs and podcasts are much better at finding and showing good ads, from interesting products.



[Squarespace][1], [Audible][2], [Lynda][3], [MailChimp][4], [JetPens][5] or [Smile Software][6] are just a few of the companies that I discovered on podcasts and blogs. And there are probably hundreds of others.



Good ads are great. Terrible ads is the problem. Irrelevant ads are the problem. Know your audience, and find companies that have relevant products for them.
