title: "The new React Context API"
---



When I spent weeks upon weeks to write about React I said that no one should use the context api because it was likely to break in the future, that time is coming. There is a new version of the [context api](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/2) on it's way into react. Look here for [details](https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-%EF%B8%8F-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b) on how to use it. 



The short version is that the new context API will be more like a component, that you either use as a "Provider" or as a "Consumer". Again, look in the blog post above for details. 



It looks like it will be a million times easier to understand and use compared to the old system.
