title: "Feedly is the worst."
---

I might have an Feedly account, but I know that I have not used it much. They have pulled a lot of shit during the last few months. And I would have blocked access for them, if I did have the ability to do it with Squarespace.



Here is the deal. If you have some kind of service that either show content – like RSS services like Feedly and FeedWrangler do – do just that – deliver the content. Don’t fuck with it. Leave it alone. Don’t try to do any crap to spike your traffic in any way.



The same goes for URL shortening services. Leave all the meta-data alone, shorten the url and leave the rest ALONE.



I will never – NEVER recommend anyone to start using Feedly.



Assholes.
