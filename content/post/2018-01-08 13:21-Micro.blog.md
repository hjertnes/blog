I finally got my invite to [Micro.blog][1] in the end of October. And I got to say: it&#8217;s awesome.



Micro.blog feels a lot like what App.net felt like, and a lot like Twitter in the old days.



I would encourage everyone that miss those times to check it out. It feels very beta at the moment, but it will get there.
