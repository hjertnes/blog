    I’m of the opinion that you should get through a day of being a tourist with a single battery in a camera. This wasn’t really a big problem with DSLR’s because my experience is that most of them will last you at least a weekend on a single charge. And I think the oldest of my Canon EOS 650D batteries still lasted me a day at the end.

    I also think that the out of the box experience should last you a day. Without digging through menu’s etc. Mirrorless systems will probably get there some day. But that day are probably at least a generation away.

    My experience shooting with my X-Pro 2 the first two days I had it was that I’d get around two hours out of a charge.

    Then I decided to play with the settings. I’m not going to change the performance settings because I like the faster autofocus and higher frame rate. But I decided to enable all the auto sleep features, and set them as aggressive as possible(sleep after 15 seconds of inactivity), and only use the camera with viewfinder + eye sensor, instead of LCD and viewfinder.

    The change? Huge.

    I have used to camera on all my walks with my dog today, and I have also shot a little bit at home. And I have around 50% left of the battery. This would have been well into the second charge with the original settings.

    This means that I’m not in that much of a hurry to get a second battery. And it also means that I don’t need to get that many extra batteries and charging systems for when I bring the camera on trips.
