title: "Two sides to everything"
---

No matter what "it" is, there are usually at least two sides to it. Usually there are some good, and some bad and a lot in between.

It is always important to be able to analyse stuff from multiple angels and viewpoints. Because it is easy to look at it from where you stand. But how does someone more conservative think about it? Someone more radical? Different groups of the society?

Each of them will react differently to different arguments.
