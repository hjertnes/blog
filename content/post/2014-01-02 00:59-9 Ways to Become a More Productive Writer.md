title: "9 Ways to Become a More Productive Writer"
---

[Productivityist][1] had a great post, with a list of nine tips for becoming a better writer. I agree with most of them. All of them are true, but one of them are a bit dangerous.



>   1. Read useful productivity books and blogs All productivity advice is not universal, and sometimes you need to do your own research to find something that will be a great fit. So, check other writersâ€™ advice and productivity apps for more information on what might work for you. I do agree that it might be useful **sometimes** to read productivity blogs, books etc. The important factor is to remember that productivity blogs, books and hacks will never be some kind of magic &#8220;trick&#8221;. They might make it easier to be more productive, and helpful tools, but you have to do the work. 



Again. A good list. I don&#8217;t tend to read that many blog-posts containing lists, but I&#8217;m glad I took the time to read this one. I have been following all of the tips in it for a very long time. I think they are useful for most writers and people that would like to get more into writing.



Be careful: productivity should not be what you do, but what you are.
