title: "Emacs Search"

I'm writing this up, because I had a hard time figuring it out. You use C-s to search in Emacs, then you type what you are looking for and hit RET (enter, return or whatever you call it). Then you hit C-s or C-r to search forwards or backwords for that phrase and repeat until you find it. If you wish to edit the phrase you do so with M-e.
