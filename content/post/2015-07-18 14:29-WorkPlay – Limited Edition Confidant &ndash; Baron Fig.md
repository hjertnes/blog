Fantastic! I love notebooks that combine blank pages with either grid or lines. Like the Field Notes notebooks from last year. The reason is simple: I usually write notes in my notebooks, but there are times, where a simple sketch is the most efficient thing, or when you doodle during a meeting / lecture because, well it&#8217;s boring.



I wish there was more notebooks like this.
