title: "Review Bodum Insulated Stainless-Steel Travel French Press Coffee and Tea Mug."
---

I&#8217;ve used these Bodum combined french press and travel mug&#8217;s a few times in the past. And now I got one for christmas this year.



I think I have to explain why it is a bad idea to have a combined french press and coffeemug. It is very important to pour the coffee from a french press and over to a coffee-pot or cups, as soon as possible after the coffee is brewed, to avvoid getting a overbrewed drink. Overbrewed coffee just tastes terrible.



It is pretty much unavoidable to get overbrewed coffee in a combined cup and french press.



When I looked at the cup, I found out that they included two different lids. One with a french press-dingus on it, and one without.



This bodum cup is in a lot of ways two different things in one. It is a usable french press, but in no way as good as their regular french press pots. And it is a very good travel mug.



I think I&#8217;ll continue using this mug. Without the french press part.



This is a very good mug, and I think everyone should take a look at it, if they want something to keep their coffee hot for a very long time. And it might also be something to look at if you need to make coffee in while traveling, for example on a airplane, train or bus ride. But something like an Aeropress would be a better option, if you need to make coffee in your cabin or when hiking.



Anyway.



A good travel mug.
