title: "Picture workflow"

What to do with the pictures I shoot with my iPhone was a big issue for me, for a very long time.



I didn&#8217;t want to mix them up with my DSLR pictures. They serve a different purpose. They are more like a memory, than the pictures you make prints from.



And I didn&#8217;t want to leave them on my camera roll.



My current workflow is the following, I upload everything to Dropbox with the app; I remove the pictures from my phone. And then, I go through all of them and add the good or important ones to Day One.



The Dropbox upload is something I do a few times a week, while the clearing out my camera roll is something I do about once a month. It&#8217;s difficult to answer how often I add the pictures to Day One, I do it when there are a a few hundred pictures.



Then I just delete everything in the camera upload folder.



The reason I ended up with Day One, is because it&#8217;s my journal. It&#8217;s the place I add everything personal and important. It&#8217;s also the app I read and browse in, when I don&#8217;t have anything better to do.
