title: "JavaScript Editors"
---

Two of the most popular editors for web developers these days are Atom and Visual Studio Code.



Both of them are developed using JavaScript and Electron. Both are great for web development and especially JavaScript. They are very similar, but still very different. I personally greatly prefer Visual Studio Code over Atom because of the fundamental differences.



Atom is a very flexible editor, you can use it as a basis to build entire IDE, like Facebook have done for their React Native IDE. To put flexibility before speed can give you some interesting results. Visual Studio Code on the other hand have a rich and flexible extension echo system, but it is far from as flexible.



I personally think VS Code is better. It is much faster. And I have zero tolerance for editors that are slow.



Pick your poison.
