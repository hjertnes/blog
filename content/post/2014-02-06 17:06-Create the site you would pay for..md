Patrick Rhone just wrote a great [post][1] called &#8220;Some Thoughts About Writing&#8221;. Patrick is my favourite internet writer, and you should go and get all of his books, and subscribe to at least [Minimal Mac][2] and [Patrick Rhone][3].



I&#8217;m not going to comment too much on what he is writing there, and you should go and read it before you move on.



Have you read it? Good!. Let&#8217;s get started.



I don&#8217;t have a direct quote, or link for this, but I often used to hear that John Gruber of [Daring Fireball][4] defined the perfect Daring Fireball reader as himself. That might sound cocky or kind of ego-centric. But, I would strongly disagree with that.



One of the things I&#8217;ve always been working against on this site, is to write the kind of content I would like to read. One of the others are to try to replicate my inner Internal monologue, in a way that makes sense to other people. My perfect reader is me. Your perfect reader should be **you**.



You can&#8217;t do wrong if you write content that you are proud of, and that is something that you would also enjoy. I have never been into thinking about &#8220;wonder if someone likes this&#8221; or &#8220;this will probably attract a lot of clicks&#8221;. I don&#8217;t care – and have never cared about that. I write for me, the stuff I need to figure out and get out there – and I write the kind of content I would enjoy.



Go out there, and create the kind of site you would pay for.
