title: "Push-Triggered Sync in OmniFocus – The Omni Group"
---

> When Push-Triggered Sync is enabled, OmniFocus for iOS will start syncing more frequently in the background as you make changes on other devices. This means that OmniFocus on your iPhone or iPad will have your latest changes right away, no matter where you make them. Because you’ll be syncing more frequently, the amount of data in each sync should also go down; your syncs will finish much faster. 



This is great news for all the OmniFocus users out there. I don&#8217;t use OmniFocus any more, but I&#8217;ll probably be back at some point, but this is a fantastic update. The time required to sync was one of the things that always drove me nuts about OF, especially on iPhone.
