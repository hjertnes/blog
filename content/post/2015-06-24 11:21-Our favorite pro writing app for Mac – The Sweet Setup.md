> Our Favorite Pro Writing App is Ulysses 



I agree, Ulysses is great. It have been one of my go to writing apps for a while now(depending on the size of what I&#8217;m writing). You have more or less everything you need in the Mac App, and it syncs with the iPad counterpart when you need something very portable.



It looks better than Scrivener, and have replaced everything I used to use it for.
