I couldn&#8217;t resist to not go &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221; on a post with that title. There is a place for both, and it all depends on what you want to do with it. My view is that you can do both, write original content, and link to the interesting stuff; the former is the hard part, linking is easy. But it is easier to get lasting readers with the former, and not so with the later; while it is easy to get more views with the later.
