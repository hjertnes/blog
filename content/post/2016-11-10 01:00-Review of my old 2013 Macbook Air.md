title: "Review of my old 2013 Macbook Air"

  <p>

    The current Macbook Air line, not the first one, is one of my absolute favourite line of laptops. Apple managed to combine power, quality and price unlike anything else. I would probably have upgraded to another one, if they had upgraded it. The Macbook Air was a strange machine because it was so powerful that it could be a cheap alternative to the more expensive Macbook Pro to many, including me; especially the i7 models.

    It is still a perfectly fine machine after three and a half years, except for that the battery is dead. And I can still do 90% of what I do without any hassle, except that it starts to feel a little bit sluggish when I’m working on projects where I need to run backends that require Windows, Xcode or importing a lot of images to Lightroom. And 256GB SSD have become a little bit too small for me. I can get around it by the Dropbox selective sync.

    My personal impression is that the modern SSD based systems made my Apple since 2011 hold up much better than their spinning hard drive counterparts. I remember my 2009 Macbook Pro felt much slower after a couple of years than this machine feels after close to four years. I just hope that the Retina Macbook Pro I’ll be ordering in a few weeks will hold up as well.

    I always have two rules when I order a laptop, max out the ram and go one step above what you <em>need</em> to ensure longevity.
