title: "Battery usage on iOS 8."
---

iOS 8 came with a feature I remember from, back in the dark days, when I was using Android. And that is a neat feature that let&#8217;s you see which apps consume the most battery.



It&#8217;s a brilliant way to see what apps you use the most, and to get some pointers on where your battery power goes.



First of all, don&#8217;t complain to developers about them being on the top of the list if you are using the app all the time. Overcast, Audible, Spotify together with Unread and Tweetbot, will probably high on my list, most of the time. The reason is simple: I listen to audiobook, podcasts and music more or less all the time when I don&#8217;t study, work or sleep. While Tweetbot and Unread is the apps I launch when I have a few minutes to kill.



I think the battery usage list is a useful feature for two reasons. You can kind of see which apps you use the most. But, you can also see if there are some app that use way too much battery related to how much you use it.



For example. I expect that the Facebook app would rise in the list, if I re-enabled the access to background updates and location data. I won&#8217;t.



Use the list, if you have some concerns about your battery life. The first thing I always do, to opitimize my battery life is to limit access to background refresh and location data. I only let a few apps have it.



Background refresh or update, or whatever it&#8217;s called, is something I limit to the apps where I need it; like unread. While access to location data, is something I limit by doing a simple test: is the app less useful without it. Tweetbot isn&#8217;t less useful without it, but Google Maps is.



The great thing about this list, is the same as with a similar feature in OS X Mavericks last year; developers have a real incentive to make sure their apps don&#8217;t use more power than they should.
