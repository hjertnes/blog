title: "How I brew Coffee"
---

I have all kinds of different ways to brew coffee at home. I have a mocha pot, two Aeropress, more French presses than I can count(people keep giving them to me for Christmas for some strange reason) and a V60. 

My preferred ways these days is to use the V60 because of how easy it is to use and clean. And I prefer the Mocha pot if I want something like an espresso. The Aeropress is awesome, but it is too much work to use it for it to be a regular thing. But I did use it as my preferred brewing method for years. 

I'm not a French press fan though. The coffee is too dirty for my taste. And the last cups always end up being overbrewed.
