> After announcing significantly more generous pricing for iCloud storage last week, but showing only U.S. costs, Apple today confirmed international pricing for the simplified three-tier structure. 



Great. It is nice to see that Apple finally have changed their prices for cloud storage, for the better. Their old prices was so ridiculously overpriced that it wasn&#8217;t even a little bit funny. The new prices are good, and comparable to the rest of the industry. My only complaint is that the free tire should be larger.
