title: "Evernote 6"
---

[Evernote][1] just released version 6 of their OS X app. And there are a lot of great things about it. For example, the first user interface redesign that looks good.



But, I have some concerns about where Evernote as a company and product is going. They have introduced two new features that I don&#8217;t get: Chat and Contexts. I can&#8217;t understand how either of them belong in Evernote. There are a lot of better chat solutions out there. And Context in it&#8217;s current form is more or less useless; and I also have som Privacy concerns. Context wouldn&#8217;t be that bad, if it was limited to your notes.



Anyways. I hope that the company moves back into just improving the product.



The thing I really hope for in 2015 is a real competitor to Evernote. They need it for two reasons: to get their act together and make the service as good as possible, and to make sure they focus on features that are relevant to the product.
