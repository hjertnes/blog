title: "My pick for best iOS nvALT companion"
---

[1Writer][1] looks like a nice app, and I would have checked it out, if I still was a [nvALT][2] user. My go to note-and-everything-else app for the last year have been [Evernote][3].



And my go to apps for writing long form on OS X is [Byword][4] and [Sublime Text][5]; and I use Byword and [Editorial][6] on iOS.
