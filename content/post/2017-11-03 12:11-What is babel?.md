title: "What is babel?"
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a> started out as a project called 5to6. It is a tool chain to transpile Javascript code. You can for example use Javascript syntax that isn&#8217;t even included in the standard yet and transpile it over to code that will work in the browsers you need it to work. It is modular, and easy to configure in most build system. I mainly use it through webpack. But you can also use it together with node.
