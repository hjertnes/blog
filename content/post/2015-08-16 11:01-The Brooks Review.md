> You see, for the normal person, owning a dSLR will not yield a better picture. It is far more likely that you will get worse picture with a dSLR than with your iPhone. I know that many of you who didnâ€™t heed my advice to not read this, are now thinking I am nuts. 



I have been saying this for years, don&#8217;t buy a mirrorless camera or a dSLR unless you intent to get into taking pictures. Which means, learning how to use your camera and having it as your hobby. Most people will get better pictures from a high-end point and shoot than they will ever get from a SLR or MFT camera.
