title: "The Cost of Mobile Ads on 50 News Websites – The New York Times"
---

> Ad blockers, which Apple first allowed on the iPhone in September, promise to conserve data and make websites load faster. But how much of your mobile data comes from advertising? We measured the mix of advertising and editorial on the mobile home pages of the top 50 news websites – including ours – and found that more than half of all data came from ads and other content filtered by ad blockers. Not all of the news websites were equal 



It is ridiculous, and out of control, boston.com had 15.4 megs of ad-content and 4 megs of real content on their front page. There is a reason I use ad and content blockers, and it isn&#8217;t because I hate ads, it is because of the trackers and the instane amount of data they use.
