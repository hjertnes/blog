All the previews are generated in the cloud, or I do at least think they are. Which means that it may take more or less time before you can process your images after a import; it all depends on the speed of your internet connection. 



For me, it took way less time when I imported two 64GB cards yesterday. But I have a very fast 120mbit connection.
