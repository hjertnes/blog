> The biggest disadvantage to the iPad Pro, right now at least, is going to be the software. There’s going to be a lot more robust software for OS X than there will be for the iPad Pro. That should change in time, especially if Brent Simmons’ interest is indicative of the greater interest. My guess is that come WWDC 2016 the iPad Pro will be a primary computer for a great many people that would have never fathomed a lowly tablet being their main computer.

    

> There’s a lot to get used to on the iPad for full time work (no mouse), but there’s also a lot of great things (focus being one). I’m very excited for the future of the iPad, and I suspect that come this time next year — well I am guessing and hoping — I won’t have any need for an OS X based computer.

    

> Who am I kidding, I might not even make it to 2016 with OS X as my primary OS. 



I&#8217;m not 100% sure, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that my future computing setup will be a iPhone Plus, iPad Pro and some kind of desktop mac. I didn&#8217;t want to do it before the iPad Pro, just because Apple didn&#8217;t look committed to keyboards on iPad, now they do.
