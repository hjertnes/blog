> Customers of the oft-criticized security and performance program MacKeeper have until Nov. 30 to file a claim for reimbursement, the result of a proposed class-action suit settlement. 



Great news. I fucking hate MacKeeper. The product is one thing, but their shitty marketing and scamming tactics are something entirely different. If [Onyx][1] and [CleanMyMac][2] are two complimentary tools that do some thing; the only difference is that they don&#8217;t scam people, and they **work**.
