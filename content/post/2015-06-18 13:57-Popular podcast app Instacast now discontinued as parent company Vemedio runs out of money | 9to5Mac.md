title: "Popular podcast app Instacast now discontinued as parent company Vemedio runs out of money | 9to5Mac"

It&#8217;s sad to see the podcast app I used from I stopped using iTunes, until I started using Overcast; with the exception of a few periods where I tested other apps.



But, it&#8217;s not a surprice. Overcast _was_ the best designed podcast app, with the best user interface. And then it became something else. It was not the best looking, but it was the one with the best design compared to the features.



And I suspect that almost everyone moved over to Overcast a year ago. Because it looks better and have more or less what Instacast have, plus more.



In other words: Instacast would have survived if they had focused more on making sure the app looked good, and worked better, and if they had made sure their paid upgrade felt like a fair trade.



Many people I know still use old versions of Instacast. I could pay $5 once a month for a good podcast app, and get more value out of it than I get from my Spotify subscription.
