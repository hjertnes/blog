I have never built anything with MobX, and I don&#8217;t think I will, unless it&#8217;s forced down over my head. But I&#8217;m pretty sure that if I had the choice between a job where I worked with redux or one where I worked with MobX, I would have chosen the former; much like I would have if I had the option between a job where I used React and one where I used Vue or Angular.



I&#8217;m not sure how it makes stuff easier, but it does at least move state management out of your components. Look [here][1] if you want a sample project / tutorial.



If you think functional programming isn&#8217;t your thing, or something like that I would look at MobX. One of the things I have heard about MobX is that it requires less code than redux. But I don&#8217;t see anything in MobX that lets you place the state anywhere in the component three like you can with redux. And the whole decorator thing feels a little bit too much like Java programming for my taste.



I don&#8217;t mind Java or C# as a backend language, but I don&#8217;t think those ideas are that great when it comes to frontend development.



It might be the right thing for you, even though I don&#8217;t like it; especially if you don&#8217;t like redux.
