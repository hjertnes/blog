title: "Welcome, Mac Power Users! â€” Relay FM"
---

**Relay.fm:**



> I&#8217;ve listened to Apple podcasts for a long time, and with over 250 episodes published, Mac Power Users has been a constant listen of mine for years.

> 

> Mac Power Users isn&#8217;t just a podcast; it&#8217;s an institution. The guest list is impressive, with greats like Rod Roddenberry, Merlin Mann, Aisha Tyler and David Allen making appearances.

> 

> That&#8217;s why today&#8217;s announcement is so exciting: MPU is joining Relay FM. 



Okay, I didn&#8217;t see this one coming, but it is really awesome to see Relay.fm doing so well.
