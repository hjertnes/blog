> Clipcast is a distributed clipboard synchronization tool for Mac OS X and iOS. Well, actually, it’s more than that. It allows you to quickly sync text, photos and web links between your desktop, laptop and iOS devices — as well as Android and Windows systems — which makes it extremely convenient. 



This one looks interesting. The thing that annoy me about the various apps I have used for this in the past is that they either doesn&#8217;t work on corporate-style networks, or that they are unmaintained. While Clipcast use Dropbox, which makes it very useful.
