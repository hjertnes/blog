Haha! Good one. I have been going back and forth on this a few times, but I have come to the conclusion that [Existential Comics][1] is a good &#8220;starter drug&#8221; for people that are interested in Philosophy, because you can always get the explaination at the bottom of the page. And remember: go back and read some of the originals, they are great.
