title: "Purchasing a new computer."
---

I finally did it; I ordered a new Macbook Air on thursday, and it arrived the day after.



## Specs.



I always chose to put in as much memory and CPU power as possible when I get a new computer; not because I need it now, but to hopefully get a computer that is usable everything from a few months to a few years longer.



## Macbook Air vs Macbook Pro with a retina screen.



I have been going back and forth on this issue many times during the last few months, and I decided to go for a new Air. First of all, I might have ordered a retina model if the new retina models have been out by now.



You might wonder why I did not wait. I didn&#8217;t wait because my old Air was very close to dying on me. And I could not afford to wait any longer.



## What&#8217;s new?



This computer is more or less the same as the one I had. It&#8217;s faster, longer battery life and much more memory.



The 4GB memory limit on my 2011 Macbook Air was without doubt the biggest issue I had with it.



Other than that? I can&#8217;t see much of a change.



## MagSafe-2



The new power adapter standard from Apple is the one and only thing that I do not like at all about this computer. I understand why they did it, but I still don&#8217;t like it.



I own many of the old Magsafe-1 chargers, five to be exact. &#8211; My office &#8211; One in each of my two bags &#8211; At home &#8211; My parents house



Because of the amazing 12 hours of battery that this model have to offer, I might not need five adapters. I&#8217;m almost never 12 hours at my office, and when I am I could just bring out the adapter from one of my bags.



## It&#8217;s a great evolution.



Very few Apple products is a revolution, but this new Macbook Air model is a great evolution, of a great products line. And I would like always recommend most people a Macbook Air.
