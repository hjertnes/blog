title: "Morning charging ritual."
---

Batteries are a pain in the ass. And I am getting kind of sick of them. Every morning when I get into the office I plug in my iPhone and my Apple Watch, then I start to charge the right AirPod, then the left. Before I then charge the case once my iPhone is close to a 100% charge. And then you have my Laptop and my Switch.

When that is charged I re plug my iPhone and leave it there for as much of the day as possible.

I think all of this charging crap have to be improved in some way sooner rather than later. Battery life in general should be improved, but I doubt that will happen. But what I hope will happen is that the time it takes to charge stuff will become much faster, and that it is easier and cheaper to use stuff like contact charging.

I'd love to have some kind of surface on my whole desk that could charge at least all the portable stuff. Either that or some modular docking systems that can be customized for what every you need.
