title: "Something old, something new, from the archives."
---

I recently made some changes to my jekyll setup to have real DF-style linking. And I have digged through all my favorites in Feedwrangler and Instapaper. These have been links I planned to post. Some are new, some are older, and some are old. All of them are posts that I enjoyed then, and all of them are posts that I still enjoy.



One of my goals for 2015 is to publish more links to interesting things I read on the net.
