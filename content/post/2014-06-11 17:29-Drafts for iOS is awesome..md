title: "Drafts for iOS is awesome."
---

Okay. So I love Drafts. I have been using it since the first version came out. Well, not all time time, but I&#8217;ve had it installed.



And then I got into it again when I got a iPhone 5S. There are a number of reasons for getting into it again. First of all, a lot of my workflow have been refocused around plain text again.



Here is the thing, you should get it. I love the fact that I have one place where I start 90% of everything I type into my iPhone. It might be a blog post, it might be a tweet or DayOne entry, or a text to my girlfriend. I even use it to write stuff I need to send to my YNAB &#8220;temp-file&#8221;. I&#8217;ll get into that in a moment.



The reason I left Draft, or left it in a state where I didn&#8217;t use it, is the fact that it became hard to manage all of my actions. This was solved when the developer re-designed the whole interface into tabs with actions.



So, I have all the stuff I use every day in tab &#8220;I&#8221;, and the stuff I use most days on tab &#8220;II&#8221; and the rest spread accross &#8220;III&#8221; and &#8220;IIII&#8221;.



So, I have a YNAB temp file. This is the place where I quickly add all of the stuff I spend money on. It&#8217;s just a text file with lines like &#8220;Food $10&#8221; or &#8220;Beer $5&#8221; etc. And then I go through it once a week and add it to YNAB; my budgeting app of choice.



Anyways. Draft is an awesome app if you just want a single place to start everything before moving on to the place they belong. You can even make your own actions.
