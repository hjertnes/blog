This one is awesome.



Let&#8217;s say you have a object, and you want to loop over the keys and values of it. There is a new method on the Object prototype for this. Just run Object.entries and you&#8217;ll get a list of list

I wonder how much code could be removed with all the recent additions to the Object prototype?
