Session storage is a key value store in the browser, that can be used for temporary storage in JavaScript apps, per tab / window / session. It used to be a very useful technique in the &#8220;old&#8221; days. I have seen some people use it instead of redux or react&#8217;s built in state for some strage reason. And I think it is a bad anti-pattern. Because of various per browsers limitations, and you miss all of the nice things about redux / react state.



If you think you need it, I would look into why. Because if to make it easier to pass data between components, then I would look into redux.
