> There’s a very fine line between what Cruz said and the fact that the Constitution forbids a religious test for public office. Cruz didn’t say atheists couldn’t run, only that they weren’t “fit” for the position. He’s entitled to his opinion and we’re entitled to think he’s an ignorant fool. 



This is a part of American politics I don&#8217;t understand; why should it matter if a Presidential candidate believes in a God or not?
