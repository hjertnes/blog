**Patrick Rhone:**



> My Grandmother was a piano teacher. She was also a world renowned concert pianist. She was awarded her Ph.D. in Piano Performance from the University of Iowa. She was also a freedom fighter, quite active in the civil rights movement in the south. She was also the author of three books about the life of a blind pianist named Blind Tom Wiggins. She was on the Board of Trusties at Dillard University for many years. She was a college professor at the University of Minnesota for about thirty years and Chair of her department for ten of those. 



My life have been a combination of luck, and just doing what excited me. And I hope I can continue to do that for the rest of my life. I believe that it is important to do things you can be proud of. That is one of the reasons I moved from Stavanger in 2012, I was sick of doing work for companies that worked for the Oil & Gass sector.



Do the kind of things you can be proud of.
