**Iain Broome:**



> This is how I carry my notebook. I take three small Field Notes and stretch different coloured bands around their spines and middle pages. I use one for general note taking, one for my novel scribbles, and one for blog post and podcast ideas. It means the notes donâ€™t get mixed up and my to do lists never meddle with my brilliant brain-splurts. It works really well. I like it.
