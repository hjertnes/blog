[Overcast][1] is the new and anticipated app by Marco Arment. I have been looking forward to this release since I thought he was doing a podcast app. And then he announced it at XOXO last year.



This is a all around great podcast app. It doesn&#8217;t have everything, but it does have everything I need, and some features I didn&#8217;t know I wanted. The app have some cool tricks, like smart EQ&#8217;ing; great for listening to podcast while walking outside. And gap compressing; great for podcast with a lot of gaps.



Marco is a classy guy. He knew that this app wasn&#8217;t for everyone. So, he added a list of podcast apps that he things is great in the app. This is amazing, and I hope that a lot of developers start copying this.



It&#8217;s a free app, with a $4.99 iAP. Go and check it out.



I would have payed up to $20 for it!
