title: "Squarespace galleries, and their portfolio app."
---

I&#8217;m a big photo nut, and I take close to 100% of my pictures with a DSLR. I have many reasons for this; they look so much better, and it also makes it possible for me to make great prints for presents.



One of the things that my Lightroom setup don&#8217;t have is an iPad and iPhone app that let me sync sets of pictures. And I don&#8217;t want to do this with Dropbox viewer apps or to use services like 500px.



I have used both Flickr, 500px and Picasa in the past. But I have come to a point where I want to control as many of the platforms that I use, as possible.



So I use a combination of Squarspace tools to make the images available on this site (if I want to), and to sync them to my iPad. This is great, if you want to show people the pictures you shot.



## Step 1



I just export the pictures, from Lightroom.



## Step 2



After that I move the folder to Dropbox/Apps/Squarespace/accountid and wait for them to upload.



## Step 3



Publish. Then I move into the squarespace admin panel, and hit the publish button in the Dropbox part of the connected account section.



## Step 4



Now I can either show people on the web, send them a link, or sync the gallery I created to my iPad and have the whole thing available offline.



The thing I love about squarespace is that you have all the tools you need to do most things. And these things are btw often available in some way on most platforms. But the thing I love about squarespace is that they are available without hassle. And the Portfolio and Gallery functionality is another one of these.
