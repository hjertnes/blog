The Apple Watch reviews are out, and I trust one person above everyone else when it comes to the first round of reviews â€“ John Gruber. The review is long, but very good.



I use my current watch for many different things, but I don&#8217;t think the Apple Watch are the best for any of them. My watch is one of the things I own and love because I don&#8217;t have to charge it every night. I can see the time, the date and the day of the week, and I can also time stuff. Something that is useful while brewing coffee, or for being an asshole when people are late.



These things aren&#8217;t something the Apple Watch is the best at. The Apple Watch is not for people like me that just want a watch, the Apple Watch is for people that want more from their watch.
