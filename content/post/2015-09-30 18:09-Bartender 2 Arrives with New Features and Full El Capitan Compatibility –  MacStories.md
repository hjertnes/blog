title: "Bartender 2 Arrives with New Features and Full El Capitan Compatibility –  MacStories"
---

> Version 2 of Bartender is now available. If you have been running the El Capitan betas, you know that version 1 required you to temporarily disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) in order to install its system file. Version 2 does not need you to perform those steps. It is fully El Capitan-compatible right “out of the box.” 



Bartender is a great app, and I think it is a must for everyone with more than a few menu bar apps.
