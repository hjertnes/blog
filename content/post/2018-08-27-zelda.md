Zelda Breath of the Wild was the first Switch game I played, and it is awesome. I have not played any other Zelda game. But I really love this one. 

It is probably the best game on the Switch, but not my favourite. 

What's great about this game is the open world of it. You can play it in any way you want.  And that is awesome. But that also means that it can be difficult from time to time to figure out what to do. 

If you have the patience for it, this can be a game you spend a lot of time in. And I suspect that I will continue to play it for a very long time.
