title: "Evernote is in deep trouble â€“ Business Insider"
---

I mostly agree with it, something I think is weird, because it is Business Insider. My problem with Evernote is that they have focused too much on extending the product, and not enough on making the core product better; the oposite have been the case, I find the core experience way worse today, than it was in 2010, something I think is sad.
