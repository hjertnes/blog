>   1. Settings gets a search option!



This is a killer feature, I have no idea how often I wonder arround in Settings to find something.



>   1. The beauty of low power mode



Finally, this will be really useful on long days, and when traveling.



>   1. Do more with an iPad and a Bluetooth keyboard



This, the new split views and the new software keyboard for iPad is one of the things that makes it a really good alternative to a Macbook Air.
