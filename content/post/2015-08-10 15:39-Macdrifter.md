**Macdrifter:**



> Ghostery is a browser plugin available for Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Opera and it dramatically speeds up the web. Ok, that&#8217;s not the goal of Ghostery, but it&#8217;s a major benefit. Ghostery blocks calls to web servers that it knows are ad or tracking networks. Some would call it an ad-blocker. I call it a drain unclogger. It prevents Web pages from making additional calls out to known bad actors. It prevents a Web site from hijacking your own browser to track you 



I&#8217;m not a fan of Ad blockers, because I believe that Ads are a fair trade when you don&#8217;t pay for the content. But I&#8217;m not okay with trackers. And Ghostery is a great way to avcoid trackers on Windows and OS X.
