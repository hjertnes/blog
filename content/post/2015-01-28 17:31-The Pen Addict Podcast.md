> Help Brad and Myke record live and in-person at the 2015 Atlanta Pen Show! 



Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley of [The Pen Addict podcast][1] launched an interesting kickstarter. They are trying to raise money for Myke to travel to the Atlanta pen show, and for them to record a live podcast from the show.



Great podcast, and interesting use of Kickstarter.



Check out the podcast, if you haven&#8217;t!
