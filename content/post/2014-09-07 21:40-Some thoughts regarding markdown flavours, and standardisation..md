title: "Some thoughts regarding markdown flavours, and standardisation."
---

Markdown is more or less the de-facto markup language these days. And some people are trying to standardise the whole thing. I, and a lot of other people have some problems with it.



My problem with the whole thing is the following 1. They didn&#8217;t give Gruber the time to answer them 2. It doesn&#8217;t come clear in the name what they are trying to do; example GitHub flavoured markdown is a good name. While Standard Markdown is obnoxious and misleading. 3. Do we need a standard?



There are many versions of Markdown; in many ways. You many different parsers for the original format that Gruber made, there are minor differences in most of them, but I don&#8217;t think this is a major issue.



And there are a few different other versions that extend on the original. Like MultiMarkdown or GitHub flavoured markdown. All of them add something to the mix, that the original doesn&#8217;t have. Which one you use, depend on your needs.



I use MultiMarkdown a lot, because I like Footnotes.



We don&#8217;t need &#8220;one markdown to rule them all&#8221;. It would be nice to have a test suite to make sure that all parsers do the basic markdown parsing more or less in the same way. But it&#8217;s not something we need to have.



The thing I would love to see is a project that takes all the different flavours of markdown out there, and highlight the differences. In other words: makes it easier for people to pick the flavour that&#8217;s right for them.
