title: "Our favorite OS X launcher – The Sweet Setup"
---

**The Sweet Setup, Joe Caiati:**



> We wouldn’t consider the OS X app launcher space a crowded one, but there are enough options out there that could make oneself think twice about clicking the download button. After numerous keystrokes and much reflective deliberation, we think that Alfred is the favorite launcher for Mac OS X. 



I love Alfred, and I have used it since I downloaded it when it came to the Mac App Store, and I have used it every day since then.
