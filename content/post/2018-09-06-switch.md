title: "The Nintendo Switch"
---

I finally got arround to buying a Switch. It have been on my list for a very long time, and it was never a question of if, but rather when. 

Long story short, they were impossible to get in the beginning, and then I didnt get around to it. 

This is the first time I'm using a hand held gaming console that feel more modern than a good smart phone as of 2010. 

The Switch looks good, the graphics are great and it feels very fast. It is a good gaming console, and supposedly also a good TV console. I have never bothered to connect mine to a screen. 

The battery life is not the best, I have not looked into it, but I think I would have to research power banks or a battery case for it, if I would use it while traveling. 

Now. The Switch is larger and much more expensive than a 3DS. Yes, I get that you can connect it to a TV and all of that. But the Switch is not the most portable device in the world. It is more like an iPad than an iPhone, if you get what I'm saying. 

It is not a bad thing, I love my Switch, but it is not the thing I expected. 

The size of the 3DS is a little bit larger than I would prefer though. It is not a problem, but it is just a little bit too large for me to feel comfortable walking around with it in one hand. 

Great device, though. Now, give me a way to play my damn 3DS games on it.
