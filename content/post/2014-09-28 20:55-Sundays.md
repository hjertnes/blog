Sunday is the most important day of the week. At least for me. I do more or less the same thing every Sunday. I have a few repeating tasks for every single one.



I have a few maintenance tasks, like tagging stuff in DayOne, adding stuff to my calendar, and tackle ten items in 1Password that need to be changed.



Sunday is the day where I do everything I need to do, to make sure that the coming week runs as smoothly as possible.



The great thing about it, is that I get all the larger things out of the way in the beginning. And I know what I&#8217;m going to do each day. And I can do more work in the beginning, if I need to do something else in the end.



I prefer to have the overview, because it makes everything so much easier.
