title: "Twitter clients"
---

I didn&#8217;t expect this, but I changed my twitter client on both iOS and OS X from tweetbot to twitteriffic.



The basic story is that I joined twitter in 2007. But I didn&#8217;t get into the native app game before early 2010. There is basically three sets of twitter apps I have used for longer periods of time. Twitteriffic, Tweetbot and the official ones.



I used Twitteriffic for OS X and iOS from 2010 &#8211; 2011, and the official for a short period before moving over to tweetbot when it was released for the iPad, and then OS X. I used the official Twitter client on Android, while I had a android device.



I got the Twitteriffic 5 for iOS when it was released. It was a very good, fast and pretty client, with the same level of &#8220;cuteness&#8221; as Tweetbot 1 and 2 had. Twitteriffic looked vert fresh, while Tweetbot started to look more and more dated.



iOS7 happened. I actually waited to see what Tapbots decided to do with Tweetbot and iOS7, I used to old and dated Tweetbot 2 all the way until they released version 3. It was good, and I used it for a while.



I replaced the old Tweetbot for iPad with Twitteriffic somewhere between when Tweetbot 3 was released and early December. I could not stand the old and dated app anymore.



And I started to see these small details that I liked better, and better. We need to face it. Tweetbot and Twitteriffic is very similar, in how they look. There is just one place to divide them two; all the minor details.



First I started to really like that cute bird. Something that made me realise something. Twitteriffic is an app that managed to do something that Tweetbot didn&#8217;t. They managed to have the same level of cuteness as Tweetbot had in the Skeuomorphic design, in their &#8220;flat&#8221; Twitteriffic 5 design.



Then I realised that I could change the font, to Avenir; a font I have fallem in love with, while using Day One during the last few years.



I also think the built-in browser in Twitteriffic looks way better than Tweetbot&#8217;s. The colour and look of the icons on the bottom in Twitteriffic is just an amazing piece of design.



But the final push happened when I finally got how brilliant the unified timeline is. The fact that I can scroll through my main timeline, and mark @-replies as read in the @-mentions tab as I go past them is amazing.



There is one thing I don&#8217;t like about Twitteriffic, and that is those weird symbols they put in the Push Notifications. I get why they are there. But they look weird and out of place.



Anyway. I would be happy in both apps, and Twitteriffic is the best one for me, for now. The OS X version of twitteriffic is kind of dated, and is close to a major version behind the iOS app. I still think it is the best one for me.



\_\_I&#8217;m finally back to twitteriffic after a few years. \_\_
