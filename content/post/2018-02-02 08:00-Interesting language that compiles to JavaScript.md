title: "Interesting language that compiles to JavaScript"
---

I&#8217;m not interested in most of the languages that compile to JavaScript. Some of them add syntax sugar (CoffeeScript), while others are too removed from the community (Elm) and others aren&#8217;t I that sure about (TypeScript).



The reason I don&#8217;t like CoffeeScript is that I don&#8217;t see anything but a different syntax to write JavaScript. In other words there are no technical reasons to use it as far as I can see. While Elm is it&#8217;s own eco system, and why would I choose to not use the community around NPM? The best of the three is without doubt TypeScript, but I&#8217;m not sure if writing C# for JavaScript is the way to go, yet.



Then I discovered [Reason)(https://reasonml.github.io/). It looks like it has a lot of what I dig about Elm (Type Safety aka discovering a majority of the potential bugs at build time) while still being able to use existing modules from NPM; and using stuff from the OCaml eco system is a great bonus.



It looks great, and I&#8217;m going to check this out in the near future. â‰ˆ
