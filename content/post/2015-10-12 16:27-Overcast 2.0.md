title: "Overcast 2.0"

Overcast is my podcasting app of choice, and have been since it came out a little bit over a year ago, and version 2.0 came out a few days ago. It introduces streaming, and a new and interesting business model: free with the option to pay, if you want to.

> The headlining feature of Overcast 2 is streaming. You can still download all episodes as you did before â€” I fixed some bugs there, too 



Great app, great update. You should check out the Macstories [review][2] if you want a in-depth article about more or less every single detail.
