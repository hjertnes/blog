title: "Five things I love about Lightroom"
---

[Marco][1], [John][2] and [Casey][3] talked about the new Photos.app in the [latest][4] episode of [ATP][5]; and I just had to write this thing: five things I love about Lightroom



  1. Lightroom is a priority to Adobe, they move fast, and even the beta versions are solid. 

  2. Lightroom wasn&#8217;t that expensive before [Creative Cloud][6]; and isn&#8217;t today; you can get a subscription to Lightroom + Photoshop for $10 a month.

  3. Lightroom lets me figure out what to keep or not faster than anything else I have tried. They have a selection called &#8220;last import&#8221;, and you can just browse through it with the arrow keys, and press the &#8220;x&#8221; button on every photo you want to delete. And just find &#8220;Delete rejected photos&#8221; in the Library menu after you&#8217;re done. 

  4. It&#8217;s easy to do the simple things I do; and I can move into more advanced things if I want to; and the recourses to learn that is available everywhere. 

  5. A library in Lightroom is a folder that contains a three things: your library file; backups of the library; and a folder structure for you pictures. This means that the files themselves are there; they aren&#8217;t hidden in a package file or anything. 



To round things up a little, Lightroom is great for anyone with either a lot of pictures, a DSLR, or someone that want something more advanced than iPhoto. The reasons I went for Lightroom a few years ago was because they kept it up to date, and the stuff I do after every time I take pictures is very efficient.



A full 16GB SD card of raw files from my camera; 500 &#8211; 600 pictures; takes 15-20 minutes to process, including importing & converting to DNG<sup id="fnref-0"><a href="#fn-0" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>; the same process took 2 times as long with Aperture or iPhoto.



I would test out both Photos.app and Lightroom when the time comes to pick a new photo management app.

  DNG is Adobe&#8217;s &#8220;raw&#8221; format; they can convert all the different kinds of raw files into DNG during import.&#160;<a href="#fnref-0">&#8617;</a> </fn></footnotes>
