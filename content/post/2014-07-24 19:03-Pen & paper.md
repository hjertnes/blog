title: "Pen & paper"

The Retro 51. This is my all time favorite pen. But, I lost the one I had sometime this winter.



But I ordered a new one a few weeks ago, and it finally showed up last week.



There are a few things I think everyone that are into pens and paper should check out. They aren&#8217;t that expensive. But they are great.



The retro is the best pen you can get. It looks good, and have the best writing experience available.



Everyone needs a few cheap and disposable pens. And my favorite is the Pilot G2. It&#8217;s not as great as the retro, but still pretty good. And the best thing is that you can buy them almost everywhere.



Let&#8217;s move on to paper.



FiledNotes are my favorites. They look cool, are durable, portable and the paper quality is awesome.



Moleskine aren&#8217;t the best paper quality available. But I use them. And the reasons similar to the G2. They are available everywhere. I can walk into almost any shop that sell notebooks and get one.



The last item on my list is a recent addition. Get a case from [Nock][1]. They look cool, and the one I got can fit at least two FieldNotes and three pens.



It makes it so much easier to find my pens and notebooks.
