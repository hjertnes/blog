title: "Better iTerm Integration in Alfred â€“ Alfred Blog"
---

> With the upcoming release of Alfred 2.7.2, the default iTerm integration has been replaced by the &#8220;Custom&#8221; scripts option. This allows for a more up-to-date and more flexible way to handle the iTerm integration, using scripts created by one of our fantastic users, Stuart Ryan. 



Check out this post before updating Alfred, if you&#8217;re a iTerm user.
