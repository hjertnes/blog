title: "Moving back to OF"
---

The key parts of my general approach to workflow, tools and everything else is that I use the thing that is correct for me right now.



I moved away from OmniFocus in december, after using my then current setup, without it being the right thing. And I continued to use TaskPaper for two whole months.



Something happened between the beginning of january and last week. I realised that I had token up so many extra projects, that I needed to go back. And there is no shame in that.



You might wonder how it is to move back to OmniFocus? And it was pretty straight forward. I know the apps in and out. What I did this time was to start with a blank database.



One of the things I miss from TaskPaper is how easy it is to do a brain dump.



It takes at least twice the time to do the same work in OmniFocus compared to TaskPaper.



It&#8217;s great to be back in OmniFocus. It is without doubt the best tool out there, if you have a lot on your plate.
