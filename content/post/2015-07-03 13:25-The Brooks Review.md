I think it will be harder and harder as we move forward to pick the iPad or the MacBook. Apple have on one side made a laptop that is very similar to the iPad, and on the other side they are making iOS 9 more powerful, which makes it more like OS X.



The big questions in the future will be about what you prefer; keyboards and operating systems.
