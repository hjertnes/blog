title: "512 Pixels review of The Magic Keyboard"
---

> In my few days of using the keyboard full-time, I&#8217;ve already learned to back off the pressure with which I type. That&#8217;s a good thing, as smashing these keys into the aluminum beneath them is going to be hard on me and the keyboard long term. 



I&#8217;m not sure if Apple&#8217;s current keyboard trend is good, bad or whatever. I have used Apple Keyboards for a very long time, but I might go for logitech the next time.
