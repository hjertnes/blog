title: "Charging the iPhone 8 Plus"
---

It takes forever to charge the iPhone 8 Plus using the charger and cable you got with the phone; and it is a little bit better if you use a iPad charger. But it still takes a very long time.



But, you can get faster charging if you take one of the Apple MacBook Pro USB C bricks and plug one of the LIghtning to USB-C cables into it. My impression is that it charges around twice the speed.



Which brings me to my point. Why can&#8217;t Apple start to bundle better chargers with their devices? Or at least a cheap version of their current chargers with USB-C instead of USB-A. To charge using the USB-A cables is horrible. It takes forever. It is bad user experience to wait longer.



I get the margins argument, that people use every time someone thinks Apple should do better. And, yes, I get that. But I just want Apple to start moving in the right direction. Because if Apple comes out with phones with bigger and bigger batteries, the charging over USB-A thing will become a joke.



If you want faster charging: get a MacBook Pro power brick (the 13 inch version is good enough) and a Lightning to USB-C cable.
