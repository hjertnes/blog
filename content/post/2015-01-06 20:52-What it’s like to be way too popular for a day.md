> Most of my posts go effectively nowhere, but occasionally, one will unexpectedly go really far — and this blew past everything I’ve ever done. When that happens, there’s no chance to revise, no room for error, and no way to stop it.

    

> If there’s any flaw, it’s an unstoppable nightmare of embarrassment and guilt. Most people, myself included, aren’t accustomed to that level of scrutiny. Those who are usually have PR training, editors, and handlers to protect them from publishing flippant blog posts before they go to bed.

    

> Instead of what was intended to be constructive criticism of the most influential company in my life, I handed the press more poorly written fuel to hamfistedly stab Apple with my name and reputation behind it. And my name will be on that forever.

    

> Had I known that it would go as far as it did, I never would have written it.

    

> I now need to write everything with the fear that any hastily written article might end up on TV, with the most extreme word in the article singled out with my name on it forever.

    

> I’ll keep writing — I can’t stay away. But academically, it’s not worth the risk. 



I feel bad for Marco, and I liked the original post. Most of what I write don&#8217;t go anywhere, and most of the stuff the bigger Apple sites write never go anywhere outside our little bubble. A lot of them agree with what he said in the original post.



People that read Apple related sites like Marco.org, DaringFireball and MacStories have a context. They understand where it&#8217;s coming from, and why. I don&#8217;t think mainstream media and everyone else have the same kind of content. I really hate it when you see a storm in a teacup just because someone don&#8217;t understand the context.
