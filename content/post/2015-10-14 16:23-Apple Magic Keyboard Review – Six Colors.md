title: "Apple Magic Keyboard Review – Six Colors"

> The major key differences are the left and right arrow keys, which are now full-sized—I used the empty space around the arrows to orient on the keyboard, so occasionally I find myself completely at sea when typing and my text editor will get xinikerejt xibdyaws. (I’m sure I’ll adjust.) The function keys, formerly half height, are now full height. 



It looks interesting, and I think I&#8217;ll be buying both the new keyboard and the new trackpad, now that they finally have re-chargable batteries.
