title: "Averages, medians and patterns"
---

There are two things that always happens when someone discuss when Apple will update &#8220;device X&#8221;. They go to MacRumours, to check how many days since the last update, and the average number between each update.



And then I think – is it relevant?



Let me explain. I think the patterns in how often they update something is way more important than the last time, and the average.



It doesn&#8217;t matter anyway. Apple will realease something new – when they are ready.
