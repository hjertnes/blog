title: "Rate your podcasts."

This shouldn&#8217;t be a big surprise to anyone that know me: I&#8217;m a huge fan of podcasts. And there are a few ways you can help podcasters out. You can write about them on your blog, or tweet about them; something I do often when I discover something new. The obvious one is to visit their sponsor, and buy the thing they are selling.



But, one of the most important things you can do is to review them on iTunes. I haven&#8217;t reviewed many of the podcasts I have listened to over the years. It&#8217;s a hassle. I don&#8217;t use iTunes to sync or listen to podcasts.



So, I had this idea last night. While listening to Ben Brooks new [podcast][1]. I&#8217;m going to review every single podcast I&#8217;m listening to.



The reasons for writing a review, or rate a podcast in iTunes is very simple. Most people subscribe to podcasts with iTunes. Rating and reviews are the thing you can do to make sure more people see the shows you love.



Podcasts need bigger audiences to attract new sponsors to make the whole business viable. They can&#8217;t rely on Squarespace forever.
