title: "Alternote Review"

MacStories have a review of Alternote; my favorite way to use Evernote for notes.



Evernote is great, and you can use it for a lot of different things, I mostly use it to manage files, shared notes and archived projects and files. But Alternote makes Evernote a good option to Dropbox + nvALT on the Mac, and I would consider switching to it, if there was an iOS app.
