Swift starts to look better and better. I have been thinking about getting back into iOS development for a while now; and I think Swift is the language. But I&#8217;m doing the same as Marco, I&#8217;m waiting at least another year before learning it. Languages and frameworks change a lot in the beginning. And I don&#8217;t have time for that.



But I&#8217;m pretty sure that Swift is the future. And I&#8217;m also sure that Swift will make iOS development more accessible for web developers; like Javascript, Perl, Python and Ruby developers.
