title: "Alphabet"
---

Interesting.



> Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President. 



Most of the stuff most of us think about when we hear &#8220;Google&#8221; will remain there, while some of the other stuff like for example Nest will be sister comanies to Google.



It kind of makes sense. But the fact that YouTube is a subsidiary of Google instead of Alphabet is something I don&#8217;t get.
