> At a party, you will find me being gregarious and able to easily engage in conversation with others. At a conference, I have little problem discussing the points of the speaker or opening a dialog in the hallways with fellow attendees. When I was a student in class, I never had an issue with raising my hand and asserting my view when called upon. I even engage store clerks with friendly trivial banter about the quality of the day. “Quiet” is not the first word that would come to mind to describe me — even by those who know me well or have known me for a long time. 



This piece by Patrick Rhone is fantastic.



I get annoyed when people use &#8220;introverted&#8221; instead of &#8220;being for myself&#8221; in a sentence. For example &#8220;I have been very introverted the last few days&#8221;.



I&#8217;m a introvery, but I don&#8217;t have a problem talking in front of large amounts of people, or to do jobs that most people think about as &#8220;extroverted-jobs&#8221; like street or door to door sales. There are different versions of introverts, and extraverts.



The difference is not in how loud or quite they are; the difference is in how they re-charge. I re-charge by being alone, by myself, while an extrovert do the same by beign around other people
