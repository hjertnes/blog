title: "Everyone else is not an argument"
---

I often see people doing stuff just because "everyone else" are doing it. Both in life and in software projects. You should not use React or Vue or what ever just because everyone else are doing so. Everyone else is not an argument. It might be a good idea to look into it. But it is not an argument.
