**Federico Viticci:**



> With version 5.3 of 1Password for iOS, the team at AgileBits has shipped considerable improvements to the app&#8217;s action extension, launched alongside iOS 8 back in September. In the updated app, the extension is now almost on par with the browser extension found in 1Password for desktop computers, which means I&#8217;ll no longer wish for the “real” 1Password extension whenever I&#8217;m logging into websites or setting up new logins on my iPhone and iPad. 



Finally, it is great to see AgileBits improving the 1Password extension, it is the extension I use more than anything else on my iPhone.
