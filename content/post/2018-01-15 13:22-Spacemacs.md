title: "Spacemacs"

There is some confusion about what Spacemacs is for some strange reason. A lot of people seems to believe that it is a fork of Emacs. It might be beause of the writing on their website, that kind of supports that statement. But it is wrong. What Spacemacs is, is rather simple, it is a git repository that is a emacs configuration. It comes with a lot of great features out of the box and it also auto updates. And it also has a special way of configuring your emacs setup.



There are many good things about that. It does make it easier to get started with emacs, because most of what most users want works out of the box, as long you activate the right &#8220;layers&#8221;. And the way you configure spacemacs also makes it less likely that you end up in &#8220;emacs.d bankrupsy.&#8221;. Something that we VIM users used to mock emacs users for. It is when you end up in a place where you can&#8217;t figure out how to fix your config and have to delete it.
