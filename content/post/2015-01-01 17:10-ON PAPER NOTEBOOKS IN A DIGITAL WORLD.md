title: "ON PAPER NOTEBOOKS IN A DIGITAL WORLD"
---

Stephen writes about using paper notebooks in a digital world:



> It started as a way to journal on the go, but that was replaced by [Day One][1] pretty quickly. My use of paper notebooks evolved into a low-friction capture system for notes during phone calls, meetings and brainstorming sessions. 



I love using pen and paper, like you might now. And what he writes at the end is more or less the reason I started using pen and paper, a lot, about 2-3 years ago.



> In a digital world, there&#8217;s still a place for things like paper notebooks. They can&#8217;t cause distractions in meetings and don&#8217;t require Wi-Fi. While I try to be good and not have much just in a Field Notes notebook, if something is, I can get my hands on it later quickly.
