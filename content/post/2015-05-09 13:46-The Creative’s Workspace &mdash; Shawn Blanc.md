I don&#8217;t get the clean desk thing. Mine is always a mess. I have a very long desk, and it is a mess. With an empty hole in the middle – this is where I work.



Mostly writing in my Hobonichi Planner, a Field Notes, a regular notebook or on my MacBook Air.



I don&#8217;t need a tidy or well designed desk to work, I just need a flat surface large enough to fix a few books, a notebook and some kind of computer.



Does this mean I never clean my desk? No. I usually do it either once a week or when I&#8217;m done with a project.
