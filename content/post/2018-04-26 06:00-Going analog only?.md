title: "Going analog only?"
---

Every now and then I consider ditching digital photography and move over to just shooting analog. 

And I think I would, if two things would happen: cheaper film and someone would start to produce mechanical SLR cameras with lenses again. Something like my Nikon FM. 

Why? Because analog cameras are so much simpler. They almost never run out of batteries, and when they do I can buy new ones at a grocery store. 

I know Leica still makes analog cameras, but that is a little bit too expensive for me. And I think there is room for someone to make cameras like Canon and Nikon did at the end of the 70s.
