[Editorial 1.1][1] information.



This is amazing news. I really look forward to both the iOS7 look and feel updates, and the _iPhone version_. I love Editorial. But I don&#8217;t use it much, and that&#8217;s because of the lacking iPhone version. I love the iPad, but my iPad is old. And the iPhone is without doubt the device I carry everywhere. It&#8217;s also the devie I use the most.



I would also love to have some kind of Editorial for OS X.



Great news, I can&#8217;t wait for it.
