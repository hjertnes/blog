title: "Org-mode versus Taskapaper. "
---



I love Org-mode and I love Taskpaper. But I like each one for different reasons.



Taskpaper as a file format works much better for me, than the org-mode format. But I think org-mode as a piece of software is much more powerful and is much better when it comes to management. In other words: I prefer writing in the taskpaper format, but org mode is more fun to use. 



I have written a very simple [python](https://github.com/hjertnes/tp2org) script to convert taskpaper formatted text to org-mode formatted text in order to make it a little bit easier for me to use both.
