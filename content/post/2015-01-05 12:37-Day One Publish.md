title: "Day One Publish"
---

I was really excited about [DayOne&#8217;s][1] [publishing][2] feature, when it launched. And I still like it, a lot. There are a lots of good blogging platforms out there; Squarespace, WordPress, Tumblr, Jekyll. And you have excellent platforms for sharing stuff; twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Flickr, Instagram etc.



But there aren&#8217;t any other solutions to what DayOne have done with Publish. It&#8217;s a service that is between your journal, twitter and blog. I love having everything important to me in DayOne. I can just browse there and find stuff that means a lot to me.



There are a few things I have used Publish for. And I have some ideas for what Publish is good for.



  * Writing letters. I have done this once, and I&#8217;m going to do it again. I wrote a letter in DayOne, to have it there. Then I published it, and shared the link. 

  * Pictures and text. The core of DayOne is writing and pictures. And Publish is a great feature to share them with your frinds or family. 

  * Anything written that you just want to share with a limited audience. 



The great thing about Publish is that it&#8217;s like a private blog or twitter. Everything is private, that&#8217;s the default. And then they added Publish. You can share that one thing with that person or group. I love using twitter and this site. But there are thing that don&#8217;t belong in the public, and publish is my &#8220;blog&#8221; or &#8220;twitter&#8221; for that content.
