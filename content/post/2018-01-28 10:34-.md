I start to think about the ethics of using some rhetorical devices every time I use some of them like sarcasm or over exaggeration to make a point and someone don't understand it.



Part of my personality is to talk in a way where one should not read what I write or hear what I say sentence by sentence. This means that you will probably not understand what I'm talking about, if you do so.



For example yesterday, when I compared using Windows or Android to the torture of a really strict diet. Does this mean that I would rather go on a really strict diet than using Windows? No. It just means that Windows(and Android) is my least favourite operating system. And when I say "Visual Studio is the only acceptable reason to use Windows", this means that I think it is acceptable to use Windows when there are some really good piece of software that you need that only run on Windows.



On one side is it not fair to the world that I talk and write in a way they don't understand. But on the other side: is it fair to me that I hide or edit part of my personality away?
