title: "Listen to podcasts at whatever speed you want &ndash; Marco.org"

**Marco:**



> I’m a purist for a lot of things. As I’m writing this, I’m drinking Kenya AA coffee, black (of course), that I roasted myself a few days ago. And I’m listening to music — a full album, in order — on what I can confidently say are the best headphones in the world.

    

> But if everyone had to drink coffee black, there would be far fewer coffee drinkers, and the business would dramatically shrink. I also wouldn’t expect much success in the music business if I spent a lot of time pleading with people to please stop listening to shuffled, streamed singles on earbuds and Beats because that’s “not what the artists intended”. 



Some people like it the right way, while others want it their way. I prefer listening to podcast as fast as possible, with smart speed enabled. While other want it the &#8220;right&#8221; way.



I have come to the point in my life where I don&#8217;t give a fuck. Do it your way, just find something you are a purist about; but remember, it is like religion or a penis, it&#8217;s okay to have it, just don&#8217;t show it in someones face.
