**David Pogue:**



> I’m 51 and a former professional musician. I know how to listen. But when I bought Pono’s expensive remastered songs and compared them with the identical songs on my phone, I couldn’t hear any difference whatsoever.

> 

> I got worried. Is the Pono story a modern-day “Emperor’s New Clothes” fable? Were those famous rock stars just imagining things?

> 

> There was only one way to find out: conduct a blind trial, using identical songs on identical headphones, comparing the Pono with a standard audio player — an iPhone. So that’s what I did. You can watch the process in the video above. 



Check out the video. Audio and screens, there is a point where you just can&#8217;t see the difference. MP3 files back in the 90&#8217;s was bad. But what we get with modern MP3, AAC or just any streaming service is pretty good. It&#8217;s not perfect.



Pono was a bad idea from the start. A lot of people hate digital music because of what they think it is; this is the result. A player that delivers audio with a level of quality that most, if any human can distinguish from a high quality iTunes audio file.
