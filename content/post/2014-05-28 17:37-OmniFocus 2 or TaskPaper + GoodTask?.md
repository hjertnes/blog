title: "OmniFocus 2 or TaskPaper + GoodTask?"
---

OmniGroup released OmniFocus 2 for mac a few days ago; or something. I started to write this at the day. But then I got busy, and wasn&#8217;t able to complete it.



You might know this already, but I have been &#8220;on and off&#8221; OmniFocus quite a few times during the last six to eight months.



Let me start at the beginning. I have been using the OF 2 betas during both of the beta phases. And I liked it. But I&#8217;m not going to buy OF 2 for mac, right now.



One of the reasons for this is that OF is a overkill for what I look for and need in a task manager.



I have been doing one thing every time a new major version of an app comes out. And that is to look into if I need to update, and if the app is the best fit for me anymore. OF isn&#8217;t the perfect fit for me anymore.



My workflow during the majority of the last eight months have been either TaskPaper + Reminders or OmniFocus. My Taskpaper and Reminders workflow have been to use Reminders for repeating tasks or anything with a due date. And TaskPaper for everything else.



The thing I love about TaskPaper is that I can add 100 task in the same time as I can add 25 in OF. The other thing is that it just gives me a list, that I can add tags to, group in projects. And the powerful filtering syntax gives me what I need.



I use Reminders for everything else. It just works. One of my problems with Reminders have always been that the built in Apple apps are terrible. But then I found GoodTask. It&#8217;s a great set of apps for both iOS and OS X. You should check it out, if you are using Reminders.



The thing I love the most about GoodTask for OS X is the awesome forecast view.
