title: "Keys"

You have probably noticed that I have included keys on most of the examples where I list stuff. This is a very important part of writing performant react apps. They are not required, but recommended. The key should always be the same for one entity, I usually use the primary key of the entity I&#8217;m listing out. In other words: the key for one row should always be the same, so no random keys.



There isn&#8217;t much to the keys really. It is just a prop react use to keep track of what to do when a list of something changes. Is it a new entity? Did the entity change? Or was a entity removed. You don&#8217;t have to use them, but react will give you warnings in the console if you don&#8217;t, and you will notice the difference when you update large lists of things.
