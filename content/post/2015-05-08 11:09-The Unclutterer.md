**David Caolo:**



> Iâ€™m a confirmed gadget nut, and therefore many of my preferred tools for productivity and organization are electronic, including hardware and software. Yet, I still keep and use a paper notebook almost every day because I love my paper calendar and notebooks. This can be hard to reconcile. I am continually asking myself questions, such as: Why am I writing things down twice? And, um, where did I do that recent brainstorming session, on my notebook or computer? 



I use notebooks for many different things these days. My GTD system is in Field Notes, and the notes that have a very limited life span also goes in Field Notes. I write all my notes from lectures, studying and meetings in a larger notebook. And I use a paper journal.



The reason I have moved most of my stuff over to pen and paper is simplicity, they don&#8217;t require a battery, and there are no distractions.
