title: "What’s So Special About the AeroPress"
---

> In more ways than one, I grew up in a fussy coffee home. My parents didn’t want me drinking coffee until I was 16 because they were concerned the caffeine would stunt my growth. Who knows.

    

> My home was also fussy about coffee because my dad only ever brewed with a french press. I grew up thinking that brewing and drinking coffee was a special thing. I still think that.

    

> I’m now 33, and have more than made up for the cups of coffee I missed out on the first half of my life. In my kitchen we have a cupboard dedicated entirely to coffee contraptions: a Mokapot; a stovetop espresso maker; an Espro brand french press, a classic Bodum french press, and a single-serving french press; a vacuum siphon coffee maker; two different styles of V60; the Clever Dripper; a Kalita Wave; an Able Kone system; and, of course, the AeroPress.

I love my AeroPress, I have two of them. They are cheap, easy to use and make very good coffee. They are also very easy to clean. The funny thing about this simple plastic device is that it often make better coffee than expensive espresso machines I have tried. My advice to people that want to get into coffee is always to get a AeroPress, a good grinder and Chemex. Some people want to make espresso, while others want something closer to pour over. Both of them make excellent coffee.
