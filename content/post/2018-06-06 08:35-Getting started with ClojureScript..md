title: "Getting started with ClojureScript."
---

I have been playing around with ClojureScript a lot the last few months. A lot of it together with React. No matter what you do, use the "official" [fighwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) lein template. I used a reagent specific one for a while, and it caused me a lot of grief. Pick either Reagent or Om(the two most popular ClojureScript wrappers for React. I personally prefer Reagent because it feels the closes to regular React. 

The official figwheel template works great, no issues with it at all. I just picked another one because I didn't know what I was doing. It compiles down to a single JS file. And you can run it through webpack or other build tools if you want to.
