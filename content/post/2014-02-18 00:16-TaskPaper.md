TaskPaper themes is one of the many interesting parts of it. The themes in TaskPaper is both what you expect it to be, modifying how your TaskPaper looks: colors, fonts and text-sizes. The regular stuff. And this is what you expect from any kind of theme support in apps. There is nothing revolutionary about that. I wouldn&#8217;t write about this, if that was the case.



One of the things I love about the theme’s in TaskPaper is the ability to apply special formatting to tags. Yes – tags. What I love about this is that it makes it easy to highlight and make each of your main tags to stick out.



Let’s take an example. I want my [@today](https://micro.blog/today) tags to stick out, because it makes it easy to see them when I’m just scrolling through my main TaskPaper file. I also want everything that I tag with either [@next](https://micro.blog/next) or [@tomorrow](https://micro.blog/tomorrow) to stick out, both of them in a different way; and less so than @today.



I’m baffled by how cool some of the features in TaskPaper is; the tags, the themes, the search and the general flexibility.
