I join my parents at their vacation home once a year. And I enjoy it. The thing I like the most about it is how quiet everything is. It&#8217;s not just less noise than I&#8217;m used to, but it&#8217;s also less stuff going on. Everything from life itself, to the internet.



I&#8217;m not one of those people that go &#8220;off the grid&#8221;. I just enjoy being places not reading e-mail, twitter and rss for a few days. Three to four days, where I&#8217;m reading my e-mail once a day is brilliant.



I&#8217;m going tomorrow. And I look forward to it.



It&#8217;s a great opportunity to take some pictures, shrink my podcast queue, read a few books and read everything in Instapaper.
