JSX is the syntax we use to define markup with React. It combines Javascript code and markup together in a very flexible and powerful way and is without doubt my favourite thing about React. Everything you use in JSX that isn&#8217;t Javascript code, is technically components. All HTML tags are implemented as Components in React. For example the h2-tag is a h2 component inside the React package, with the appropriate params defined to a HTML attribute; note: they are not always the same though.



Everything that you wrap in HTML tags (either self closing or not) are components and everything inside curly braces are javascript code.



For example:

That would be a common starting point for a simple React app.



I personally think that JSX is the first templating system I have seen that is powerful, without adding a lot of syntax that isn&#8217;t plain Javascript and HTML. Most other ways to template I have seen almost turn it into a language of its own that let you combine code and markup.



The great thing about this is that almost everyone gets it straight away.
