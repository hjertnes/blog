title: "The Drafts Inbox for Plain Text Tasks"
---

**Macdrifter:**



> Using plain text to manage my projects means I have a lot of flexibility for viewing, editing and adding new entries. When I&#8217;m on my phone, I mostly lean on quick viewing and adding. I will occasionally review a project but my phone is primarily a way to input tasks. I use Drafts for iOS, of course.
