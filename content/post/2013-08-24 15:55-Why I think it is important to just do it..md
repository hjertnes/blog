title: "Why I think it is important to just do it."
---

I try to say this as often as possible, and in a why that is universally in a way where you can use it in as many areas as possible.



There are always to kinds of people, those who do, and those who want to do.



Let&#8217;s take some examples in two areas that I spend a lot of time with; writing and photography.



**Photography.** I know a lot of very good photographer talk against the approach of just &#8220;taking&#8221; pictures everywhere; and more about planning and all of that stuff. This might be important later down the line, but I think this is bullshit when you are starting out.



I always bring my camera where ever I can. I went outside a ten minutes ago to smoke a cigarette, and like I often do – I brought my camera. I shot 10-15 pictures, I don&#8217;t know if any of them was good.



I usually just shoot a lot of pictures when I am out, and then look at them when I am back.



The reason for this is that I usually can&#8217;t judge if they are that good without looking at them in Lightroom.



I don&#8217;t bring my camera because I expect to take the most amazing picture, when I am out for 10-15 minutes. The only reason for bringing it is to shoot, keep trying to get the picture I really want, the one I have been trying to shoot since march of the stuff around my house.



You will get a hell of a lot better at it by doing it every day.



**Writing.** I do it a lot. Every day. If I get an idea, and is somewhere and have the time, I will usually start writing it there and then.



Most of my stuff is not published right away. Just keep writing, keep writing – you will get better all the time.



**Critical.** You need to be critical, not matter what you are doing. You need to understand or get an understanding for what is it about whatever you are doing that is not as good as the stuff the great people in the area is producing.



Focus on one thing, and try to get better at that.



No one expect you to go from being an average blogger to John Gruber, Merlin Mann or Patrick Rhone over night; just give it time and try to get a little better every week.
