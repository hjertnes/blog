> Today as Dave Caolo and I were doing our Blab broadcast of the Apple event, I was using my 27-inch iMac as the streaming machine and a conduit to social media. For the actual livestream of the event, I was using the beautiful Retina screen on a 12-inch MacBook. My iPad Air 2 was sitting downstairs, sucking down energy. After the event I began to do a thought experiment about whether an iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard could hypothetically kick the petite rear end of the 12-inch MacBook or any other MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. Here are my thoughts, which I&#8217;d love for you to tear apart.
