**Casey Liss:**



> I’m pretty pleased with myself.

    

> I didn’t set out wanting to take a great picture in manual mode; I just set out to take a great picture. Since I’ve been taking pictures with this camera for nearly a year now, I’ve built up more and more confidence over that time. Thanks to just being patient, and trusting my instincts, I was able to, well, level up my skills.

    

> As it turns out, there’s no shortcut to lots of practice, and time.
