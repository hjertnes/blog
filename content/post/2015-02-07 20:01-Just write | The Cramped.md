title: "Just write | The Cramped"
---

> “Take out another notebook, pick up another pen, and just write, just write, just write. In the middle of the world, make one positive step. In the center of the chaos, make one definitive act. Just write. Say yes, stay alive, be awake. Just write, just write, just write.” 



— Natalie Goldberg in [Writing Down The Bones][1]



This is the book that made me go from that dumbass that called himself a writer, to the guy that have spent too many hours either typing into a computer or writing in a notebook; or writing on my iOS device.



This is the book that started it all. I first heard about it on [Back to Work][1], many years ago. I have the e-book, and I have the audiobook. It is like GTD for writing, for me.



You need to read it.
