title: "Be the best you can."

I have been reading Randy Murray&#8217;s [blog][1] for a long time now. And I love it.



Check out the link, it&#8217;s about sucking.



I started out being a terrible writer. I never cared about writing. And then I started a blog. I have written many hundred thousands of words, if not millions. And I still think I suck. But I show up almost every single day. And I do the best I can.



My goal is always be as good as I can be.



I don&#8217;t think you can ever reach the level of your heroes.



There was this interview with BB King that I saw on YouTube a few years ago. I can&#8217;t find it right now. But it was great. He talked about how he thinks that he wasn&#8217;t as great as the people that was his heroes growing up. And BB is the fucking kind of the blues.



Keep writing or whatever you are doing. That&#8217;s the only way to get better at it.
