title: "1Password X"

1Password X is awesome. If you use Linux, or some other platform like Chrome OS, where 1Password don't have a native app, you can use their "Chrome App" called 1Password. The difference between this and the regular extension is that the extension requires you to have the native 1Password app installed, while X does not. 

It is awesome. But the user experience of using it is not as great as the regular extension yet (like copying OTP codes on fill in doesn't work yet).
