title: "Apple Music is a nightmare and Iâ€™m done with it"
---

Oh man! There are some problems with Apple Music. And I get why some people want to ditch it. I personally archived my old iTunes library, and removed almost everything from it, a long time ago. In other words: I have a pre-Apple Music, and a pre-Spotify copy of my iTunes library .



The problems with iTunes and everything related to it is that it is just a mess. Everything from the user interface to old stuff they can&#8217;t remove.



I feel bad for Jim, and I get why he left. But I&#8217;m willing to give Apple the full three months before I make up my mind.
