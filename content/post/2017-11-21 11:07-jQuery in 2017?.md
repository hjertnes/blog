title: "jQuery in 2017?"
---

jQuery was THE SHIT like 10 years ago. I wrote my first large Single Page Application using it, and it still played a big role in writing SPA&#8217;s using knockout etc for a long time. But the big question is: are there still a place for libraries like jQuery in 2017?



I&#8217;m not sure if there is or should be room for jQuery with libraries like Angular, Vue or React; because of the differences in how they work with the DOM. With libraries like jQuery you treat the DOM as the &#8220;truth&#8221;, while with for example react you render things to the DOM from data in Javascript. Then you soon end up with some &#8220;interesting&#8221; results if you add some jQuery plugin or code that starts to change the code you just rendered.



But I do believe that there are many situations where React or Angular is 100% overkill, and a tool like for example jQuery is the right one because you just need to ajax and a few click events.



Should you spend time learning it? I wouldn&#8217;t. Learn ES2017, learn React etc. And I think most people will pick up on jQuery very fast, if they need to.
