title: "On Peace."

One of the first things I started looking for when iOS 9 came out was a good Content Blocker, not because I hate ads, but I hate trackers and intrusive ads. And I went for Marco&#8217;s [Peace][1][(original blog post)][2], because I like Marco, and because all the apps he have released previously have been excellet, and Peace is not an exception.



> Today, I’m launching my own iOS 9 content blocker, called Peace, to bring peace, quiet, privacy, and — as a nice side benefit — ludicrous speed to iOS web browsing. 



One of the problems with Peace was that it didn&#8217;t have a way to add exceptions(yet), and Marco had to take the difficult decition between blocking the ads he has on his site, that most of his friends also have, [The Deck][3], which are doing it the right way, or to follow the Ghostery database as it is.



As he writes in his blogpost about the [topic][4]:



> And once I looked at it like that, it wasn’t a difficult decision. It’s uncomfortable, but I’d rather be consistent and fair. 



[The sad thing is that Marco pull&#8217;ed the app only two days after it was released.][5] 



> I know pulling Peace from the store after just two days is going to be an immensely unpopular move, and subject me to a torrent of unpleasantness. But that’ll end soon enough, and that’s better than how I’d feel if I kept going. 



He is obviously walking a way from a lot of money, which is something I really admire. I always respect people that do what makes them happy, instead of what makes them the most happy. But I don&#8217;t think Marco deserved the amout of bullshit he got because of Peace, it was a good app, and the ad industry have themselves to thank for ad blocking becoming a thing.
