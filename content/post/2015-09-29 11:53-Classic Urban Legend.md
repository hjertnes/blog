> NASA did not spend millions of dollar developing a pen that would work in zero gravity while Soviet cosmonauts opted for using pencils. Pencils were used in early missions into space by both the Americans and the Russians, but other solutions were sought when pencils were discovered to be a potential danger. Exclusive of NASA’s influence and financing, Paul C. Fisher and the Fisher Pen Company invented and designed the AG-7 “Anti-Gravity” Space Pen which was patented in 1965. It is estimated that Fisher spent roughly $1 million dollars of his own money designing the AG7 over a period of several years. The Fisher Space Pen was eventually pitched and sold in bulk to NASA in 1968 and then to the Soviets in 1969. It is still manufactured and carried into space today by American and Russian space agencies.
