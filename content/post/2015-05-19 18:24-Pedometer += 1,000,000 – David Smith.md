**David Smith:**



> Yesterday Pedometer++ had its one millionth download. Here is the story of how it got there. 



Fantastic, I love Pedometer++. I use the app to keep track of my steps, and to keep track of how much I move from day to day.



The thing I love about Pedometer++ is that it does exactly what it needs to do, and nothing more.
