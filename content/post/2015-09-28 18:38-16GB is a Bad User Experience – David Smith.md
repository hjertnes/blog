title: "16GB is a Bad User Experience – David Smith"
---

> While I am typically in the ‘friends don’t let friends buy 16GB’ club, for the last year my wife has used a 16GB iPhone 6+ as her primary phone. I had initially purchased the phone as a testing device that would spend most of its life in a drawer on my desk so didn’t opt for any extra storage. Soon after it arrived she decided she wanted to try out the bigger screen size and quite liked it. So while I’d usually not have bought one, this situation allows me to see what a 16GB device is like in typical use. 



I try to talk everyone I know, that are in the market for a new iPhone out of the 16GB model. Go for 64GB, most people don&#8217;t need to manage anything related to storage with that size.
