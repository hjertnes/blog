title: "I love full screen apps"
---

I have said this before, but I have to say it again. I love full screen apps.



It might be one of my all time favourite features in OS X.



The thing I love about it is that I can just focus on one thing. Like for example right now: I have a few Byword documents in full screen, and I have one Safari window in full screen. And that&#8217;s all the apps I have running.



I can focus, on the two things that matters, at any moment. And I can focus on the one app I&#8217;m working in. It&#8217;s great.



Try it!
