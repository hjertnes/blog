title: "The 1Password audit-review – every week."
---

One of my intentions for 2014 was to do the 1Password Audit, every week. I’ve always had this as a regular task, but it was more on the monthly, every three or six months basis. And there are many reasons for me not recommending that for anyone.



Here is what I have realised when it comes to doing reviews of your passwords. You need to do it often. And here is why: &#8211; People often just sign up to services with their old “default” password without realising it(Yes, I do it too) &#8211; It’s more secure &#8211; It’s easier to do and complete a practise where you change 5-10 items once a week, and take the rest later, than to do it all in one day. The latter alternative is baffling, boring, and I ended up skipping it half of the time.



This is by the way a great chance to check out the new iOS 7 re-designed [Habit List][1]
