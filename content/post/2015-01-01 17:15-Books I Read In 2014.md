title: "Books I Read In 2014"
---

Patrick writes about all the books he read in 2014. I planned to do the same last year, but never got arround to it. I&#8217;m going to do it this year. This is the year when I&#8217;m going to write a simple book journal. Nothing big. Nothing complicated. Just a few words about what the book was about, why I read it, and what I liked or didn&#8217;t like about it. More or less what Patrick does in this blog post. And I think I&#8217;ll publish it at the end of the year.
