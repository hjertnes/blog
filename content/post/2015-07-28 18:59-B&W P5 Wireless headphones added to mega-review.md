title: "B&W P5 Wireless headphones added to mega-review"
---

My primary head phones since 2010 have been my Bose QC15, for many reasons, mainly, they are comfortable, easy to maintain(change cabel and cushions) and audio quality. But I have been consicering bluetooth headphones for a while; mainly because I&#8217;m sick of chaning cables. And the P&W P5 is on top of my list. I love Marco&#8217;s insane headphones review page. It is great for when you need to see if something is good or not, and what is good or bad about it
