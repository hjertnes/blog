title: "32 used Field Notes."
---

I love Field Notes. I think they are the best pocked sized notebooks. I use them for my todo lists, and quick notes. They look good new, used and destoryed. And most important â€“ you can use everything from a roller ball to a fancy fountain pen. And they are way better than the smiliar sized Moleskine notebooks; both in terms of durability, design and paper quality.



I have 32 used notebooks after using them for over two years. Take a look.



P.S: The Stephen King book in picture 6 is It.
