title: "Why is important."
---

I was chatting with someone on facebook this morning, and suddenly I realised something. To say something, without any context or information around why you believe or think something have to be one of the least interesting things in the world (right after religious belief).



When someone is saying something, I usually prefer to figure out they why and how before I start arguing with them. I&#8217;m not perfect with this myself, but I try to do this when I do write something. It does not matter what you think about something or someone as long as you can give a solid reason for stating it.



For example, if I write a piece about some new fancy writing app. Then I would start by writing **what** is good about it. And **how** it&#8217;s different from all of the other 100 000 iOS or OS X writing apps out there. And I would also write if I would be using it, and **why** I would / would not do so.



This is what good writing is all about.
