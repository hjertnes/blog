[Pug][1] is a template language for Javascript that I have grown to enjoy a lot. My impression is that a lot of people use it, if they use a templating engine for server side rendering using Node. The big question is if you need it or not in 2017. I personally believe that there is a place for it, when you just want to put to gether something really simple, where the interactivity of a full fledged front end system like React or Angular would be overkill. But you could probably make something similar yourself with template literals if your needs are really simple.



But I personally just go with pug, because the syntax is elegant and easy to learn. It performs well. And it is really easy to use it with Express.
