**Alfred:**



> Remote is your personal command centre for Alfred 2 for Mac. Your iPhone or iPad now becomes a perfect day-long companion to your Mac, providing you with handy icons on iOS to control many Alfred 2 actions on your Mac. 



I have been waiting for Alfred Remote app for a while now. The concept is interesting, and I think it makes my mac, my iPhone and Alfred itself more useful.



I have never been a fan of most remote control apps. Managing your mac from iOS have never been good. This is the first idea that I like.
