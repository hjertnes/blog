> ADOBE FLASH—THAT INSECURE, ubiquitous resource hog everyone hates to need—is under siege, again, and hopefully for the last time. The latest calls for its retirement come from some of the Internet’s most powerful players, but if the combined clattering of Facebook, Firefox, and a legion of unsatisfied users isn’t enough finally to put it in the ground, scroll down to see how to axe it from your devices yourself. 



Flash are already dying, there are no Flash on iOS, and the Android version was killed a long time ago. I see some Flash on Facebook, usually videos, and I once in a while(or year) see a Youtube video that isn&#8217;t available as HTML5 video.



The big question is: how soon can we get rid of the reminaing 1% of the flash content on the web? My [belief][1] is that this won&#8217;t happen before we set a date, or just kill the damn thing; because they don&#8217;t have any incentives to do so before then.
