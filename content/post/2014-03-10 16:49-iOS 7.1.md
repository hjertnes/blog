title: "iOS 7.1"
---

Apple just released iOS 7.1. It feels like a high number of iOS releases(minor and major) come out, when I&#8217;m not at home.



This is the point release to iOS that I have been looking forward to the longest. I didn&#8217;t expect iOS 7 to be any better than it was. I&#8217;m kind of impressed over how stable it was.



I know how buggy the first releases after major re-designs or re-factoring can be. I&#8217;ve done quite a few of them myself.



Check out the [release notes][1] if you want the details.



I have not played much with this release â€“ yet. But, my first impressions are that this release fixes a lot of design issues. Apple have fixed many of the UI elements that looked a bit &#8220;not quite there&#8221;, in this release. It also feels a lot faster, than the version 7.0.x releases.



I have been thinking about upgrading my iPhone 4S, to an 5S lately. I&#8217;ll might put it off for a while, if this release makes my 4S more usable again.
