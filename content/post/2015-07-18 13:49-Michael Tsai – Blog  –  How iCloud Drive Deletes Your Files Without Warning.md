This is bad. Finder should not let you move files while they are not synced.



I don&#8217;t call Apple out on stuff like this that often, but this is the bad side of iCloud. This is bad user interface design, because you are letting the user do something stupid. And it is also bad backend design, for the same reason. The only good thing is that you can restore the files.
