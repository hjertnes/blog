Arq is a app for OS X and Windows that let's you use a little bit more power user friendly version of something like Backblaze. I have been using it since this summer, and I love it. You have all the options and features you would like. And you have full control over where your data is stored. 

With something like Backblaze you get what ever storage system they are using. But with Arq you get to chose a cloud provider, for example I use S3 using the Glacier storage tier(because it's cheaper; and slower). It is a little bit more expensive per month than Backblaze, but I think it is much more convenient to back up external drives with it. And you get a lot more feedback on what's going on. 

Awesome product. You pay up front for the app, and then you pay for the storage at the provider you went with.
