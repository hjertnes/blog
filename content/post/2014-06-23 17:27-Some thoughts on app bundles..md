title: "Some thoughts on app bundles."
---

I have never bought any app bundle for as long as I can remember. Some of them have great value. And you might get a lot of value out of them. But I&#8217;m not a fan.



First of all, I try to only buy apps that I really need.



Secondly, I want to pay the full price for them. The reason I believe in paying for products and services, is that I want the people behind them to continue the development and support.



And the third reason is that I don&#8217;t want to get a handful of apps that I don&#8217;t need or want.



The next time you see a bundle where you get $400 worth of apps for $50, think about it. How much would it cost to get all the apps you want? And how sustainable is it for the individual developers?



Go and buy a great app!
