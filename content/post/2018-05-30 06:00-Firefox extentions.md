title: "Firefox extentions"

Firefox finally did something they should have done a long time ago. They re-wrote their engine, and the result is that they are faster than Chrome. I'm not going into the Safari discussion here, because the Safari team have other priorities over pure speed, like for example battery life. 

The result is that Firefox broke a lot of stuff as a result of it. What I'm wondering is how long it will take before plugins are updated â€“ and how many that aren't. And what Mozilla should do about it? Starting to hide all the stuff that aren't compatible with the recent versions?
