title: "Clojure method naming: ? and !"
---

Some clojure methods ends with either a ! or a ?. This is one of those tiny details about Clojure that I really dig. Because that single character tells me something really important about the function. 

Every method that ends with ? is a predicate. This means that it returns true or false. nil? empty? blank? are examples of predicate functions. 

The functions that ends with a ! is a little bit more complicated. All of them are inpure functions. They usually mutate state or deal with io. These are the kind of functions you want to avoid unless you have to.
