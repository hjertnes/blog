**The Verge:**



> Twitter CEO Dick Costolo is taking personal responsibility for his platform&#8217;s chronic problems with harassment and abuse, telling employees that he is embarrassed for the company&#8217;s failures and would soon be taking stronger action to eliminate trolls. He said problems with trolls are driving away the company&#8217;s users. &#8220;We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we&#8217;ve sucked at it for years,&#8221; Costolo wrote in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. &#8220;It&#8217;s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day.&#8221; 



Yeah. The problem is that Twitter never took this serious, in the first place. And then they become big, and this problem suddenly grew bigger and uglier.
