[Relay.fm][1] have been running for a while now, and I thought it was about time to write about their shows, and why you should listen to them.



  * **[Analog(ue)][2].** Was a brand new show at Relay.fm. This is one of my favorite new shows this year. Myke Hurley and Casey Liss, from [ATP][3] talk about all the &#8220;touchy feely&#8221; things. It&#8217;s a great show.

  * **[BONANZA!][4]**. This is new show on Relay. It&#8217;s hosted by Myke Hurley and Matt Alexander. This show picks up, where Bionic left off. The only word that could describe it weird. The good kind. 

  * **[Clockwize][5]** used to be a IDG show, and was brought over to Relay when Jason Snell left Macworld. It&#8217;s a short show, with two regular and two guest hosts. A great concept. And a great show. 

  * **[Connected][6]** started as the 512 podcasts, and was renamed The Prompt when 70Decibels moved to 5by5, and Federico Viticci from [MacStories][7] joined the show. It&#8217;s one of my favorite tech shows. 

  * **[Inquisitive][8]** is the next incarnation of Myke&#8217;s interview show. It started out as The Brow Show, then CMD+Space. This is without doubt one of the best interview shows out there.</p> 

  * **[The Pen Addict][9]** is the show for everyone that likes stuff like pen and paper. Brad Dowdy of [PenAddict.com][10] is the Gruber of pen and paper. You should check it out, if you have any interest in pen and paper; or if you want to get into it.



  * **[Upgrade][11]** was another new show right after the network launched. Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talk about tech. My only thought when it launched was â€“ finally. Jason Snell is a brilliant writer. And this have become one of my favorite shows. 

  * **[Virtual][12]**. I&#8217;m not really into gaming. But you should check out Virtual if you are. I listen to it now and then. Frederico and Myke talk about gaming.
