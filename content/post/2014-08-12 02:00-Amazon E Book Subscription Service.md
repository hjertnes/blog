## tags: “books amazon kindle”



I&#8217;m not even bothering to link to it, but Amazon is either planning to, or rolling out some kind of subscription service for Kindle. The basic idea is that you can download as many books you want from a limited collection of titles. Kind of like Spotify; the only exception being that Spotify have a great catalogue.



I remember reading about it a few weeks ago, but I didn&#8217;t have much to say about it. Now, I do.



I don&#8217;t think this is a good idea, and I doubt it will go anywhere.



Amazon owns one of my favourite platforms, Audible. Why didn&#8217;t they just copy their subscription model? I love it. You subscribe to either a Gold or Platinum membership. And you pay a flat fee, to download either one or two audiobooks per month.



I doubt most people read more than one or two books a month, but some people do. The great thing about a subscription to Audible is that you also buy any book in their store for a lower price.



This is what I think Amazon should have done. Books aren&#8217;t like music.
