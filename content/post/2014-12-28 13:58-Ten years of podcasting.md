title: "Ten years of podcasting"
---

> When I compare podcasting to blogging, I think about how blogging started blossoming online around 1999, tools sprang up soon after, and from about 2001–2004 I’d say it exploded and hit the mainstream in a big way. Blogging and Podcasting both began with early authors being technologists but both eventually saw more mainstream and famous authors join their ranks. Blogging took off in just a couple years, but why did it take Podcasting ten years before the mainstream noticed its existence? 



A great article about the first ten years of podcasting, and a interesting comparison to blogging.
