title: "Three cameras, and the one I don’t use."

    This might sound strange to some people, but I own three cameras, plus my iPhone. The iPhone camera is fantastic, but I realised at some point that it is not for me. Some people love to take pictures with their phone, including my girl friend. But I can never get into it. I also have the same feeling every time I use a mirrorless camera without some kind of view finder.

    I own three cameras. They are quite different, and I own them for three different reasons.

    My main, and oldest camera is my Canon EOS 650D, I think they are called Rebel or something in the US. I own a 40mm 2.8 prime and a 24mm – 70 mm 2.8 zoom lense, plus a good flash. This is the big camera. I use it every time “taking pictures” is a large portion of what I am going to do. I know how to wrangle it to get good results almost no matter where, and the battery lasts forever.

    My newest digital camera is a Fujifilm X100t. It is the perfect “bringing it everywhere” camera for me. It is a combination between a mirrorless APC camera and a phone camera. You have the flexibility and ease of use of a mirrorless system camera (coming from the photographer side) combined with the crappy battery life and small size of a phone. I decided to get this camera when I finally realised that I would never get into phone photography and this is the thing I use I I decide to take some pictures out and about or the camera I bring if I might take pictures.

    I also own a film SLR(A Nikon FM). My mother gave it to me the last time I was home. It belonged to my grand father, and I don’t think either of them used it much. There Is something to using a camera without anything else to help you than the meeter. It takes forever to take pictures, but I enjoy it a lot. I love taking a lot of pictures when I bring my Canon or Fuji, and to get a few very good shots from the hundreds I shoot, mostly shooting in either Aperture Priority or Shutter Priority. But I also enjoy to spend maybe a minute or two to set up a single shot, when I decide to take one and then wait for weeks to get the pictures back.

    The digital Leica Cameras is only interesting to those of us who enjoy the process of shooting with analog SLR’s. Vinyl records and shooting analoge is two similar things. They are technical inferior to their digital counterparts. This does not mean that you can’t enjoy the one more than the other. Vinyl sound cool, but it is not better. The same goes for digital photography over analogue. :0
