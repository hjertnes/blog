title: "13 Things to Do With All Those Blank Notebooks"
---

Ana, of The Well Appointed Desk writes about 13 ways to use some of your unused notebooks. A fantastic post. This is one of the areas where I&#8217;m kind of different from most other pen and paper geeks. I don&#8217;t have a lot of unused notebooks. I use so much pen and paper, all the time. I have the opposite problem, I run out all the time.
