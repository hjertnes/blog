    My go to headphones from I was 13 until I got my Bose QC25 in 2010 was the Bose Porta Pro. I think they were fantastic, but my impression is that the cables became gradually worse. They used to last at least a year, with more or less the same daily use as today. But then suddenly somewhere between 2005 and 2010 I suddenly had to get new ones twice, then three and then four times a year.

    Then I got a pair of Bose QC25 in 2010. They lasted me six years, until the electronics started dying. The only thing you I had to do with them was to change the batteries, buy new cables when they broke(around twice a year) and replace the cushions(I think I did it two times).

    My main expense with them was batteries and cables, so I decided to take a good and long took at the various good bluetooth alternatives available when I had to replace them. And landed on the H7. They have re-chargeable batteries, and I don’t need to buy new cables.

    I landed on the H7 because I think they sound better than the Bose QC35, and because being comfortable to wear for many hours at a time is very important to me. There are other options that might fit you better if you want something more compact.

    This might be the time where I spend less per year, while it being more or less the same, with an improved experience when I had the QC25.

    I think the H7’s are fantastic. The build quality is great, the sound is fantastic and they are comfortable to use. Bluetooth isn’t as bad as I expected, and the only times where I really hate is when I either forget to charge them or when I have to use them with my Mac. The un-pairing, pairing, use for 10 minutes, un-pair and pair again is a pain in the neck.

    Other than that: pretty great.

    I expect and hope that Apple’s W1 Chip will improve the Bluetooth stuff a lot. I will never buy anything made my Beats, mostly because they look like shit and sound even worse. But I really hope that they force the rest of the industry with them and make it a little bit better every year. Because, if the un-pair and pair process or support for multiple devices was a reality bluetooth would be good.

  </p>

    Also, not having that damn cable have made my life a million times more enjoyable. It might sound stupid. But it makes everything much easier. I can put my phone in my bag if I don’t have space in any of my pockets. Or I can walk around in my apartment while my phone is charging and still listen to music.
