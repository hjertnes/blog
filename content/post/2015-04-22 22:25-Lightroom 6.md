This is the reason I&#8217;m sticking with Lightroom, version 6 is out around two years after the previous one. I know I can trust Adobe to improve on it.



The new version have some cool stuff:



  * HDR Merging

  * Panorama merging

  * Better filters

  * And much more. 



I will be upgrading as soon as my budget allows it.
