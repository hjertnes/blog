title: "Future-safe weblogs | Manton Reece"

Domain names and hosting fees are two issues regarding having a future proof blog. But there are more. One of the key reasons I moved away from Squarespace and WordPress is that I wanted something more future proof. And this blog is readable as long as there are web browsers that can view HTML. That is one of my favourite thing about static blogging engines, you can just archive the output folder, and you have a version of the site that will work forever.



I don&#8217;t see WordPress going anywhere, but none of us saw Wordperfect og Microsoft Works going anywhere; they are gone. I don&#8217;t want to be in that situation. Jekyll is great, and they have a pretty good WordPress importer. So I would just have automated a Jekyll version of the sites that imports a WordPress export. This is what I had for the last year with Squarespace, and the 2 months I used WordPress.



The reason I did was to have a backup, if Squarespace fucked up(they never did). But I also had it to have a tested solution that I could trust, by the time I wanted to do the switch.



I&#8217;m confident that my site is future proof. I have my own domain, more or less any cheap static hosting solution can handle it, and it will work for as long as there are web browsers that can view 2015 HTML, CSS and Javascript. And it don&#8217;t rely on any server side code.
