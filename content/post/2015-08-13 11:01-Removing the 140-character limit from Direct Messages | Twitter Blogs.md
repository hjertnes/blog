title: "Removing the 140-character limit from Direct Messages | Twitter Blogs"
---

**Twitter:**



> If you’ve checked your Direct Messages today, you may have noticed that something’s missing: the limitation of 140 characters. You can now chat on (and on) in a single Direct Message, and likely still have some characters left over. 



Finally. I never understood why DM&#8217;s had the same 140 character limit in the first place.
