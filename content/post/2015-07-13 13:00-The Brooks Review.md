title: "The Brooks Review"

I did the same thing for a very long time, I just moved the same OS X Installation from one Mac to the next; from one version to the next.



My first OS X install survived from my first MacBook(which was the first white MacBook), until my first MacBook Air, running Lion. I was too scared to change anything. But it wasn&#8217;t that hard to start fresh, and I saved so much disk space, and everything was faster and cleaner.



These days I try to do a fresh install after running a beta version of the operating system. So, more or less every year.
