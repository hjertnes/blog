title: "Cool string methods"

I was looking at new stuff coming in ES7 and ES8; you know, stuff that weirdos like me do. And I came over a very cool pair: padStart and padEnd. You can run it on any string and it will pad the end or the start with a string x times. It works like this:

Looks like a great option when you just want to add X of something either before or after a string.
