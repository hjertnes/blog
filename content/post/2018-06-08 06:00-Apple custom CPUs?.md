title: "Apple custom CPUs?"
---

Apple have already moved all their non OS X hardware over to custom chips. And I think the future will bring custom Apple CPU's or systems on a chip for the rest of their hardware lineup. But that does not mean that they are moving all of it over to ARM. What I think Apple will do, if they start moving away from intel is to make the best possible chip for each of their computers. For example it makes sense with ARM for their MacBook, but the rest should probably remain on some kind of x86 style system. At the same time I think Apple could go for a tailored chip for each of their products. Because what is the "perfect" chip for a MacBook Pro is different from a MacBook; and the best chip for an iMac is different from a iMac Pro or Mac Pro.
