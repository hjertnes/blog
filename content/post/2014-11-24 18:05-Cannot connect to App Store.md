title: "Cannot connect to App Store"
---

I spent a large portion of the weekend trying to figure out why I couldn&#8217;t access the App Store from my phone. The strange thing was that the step listed at all the sites I visited didn&#8217;t work. But I finally managed to find out how to fix it last night.



I&#8217;m just writing it up here, to know where to look the next time around. I&#8217;m going to include all the usual tips, plus the thing that solved it for me.



  1. Restart your phone. 

  2. Hard reset: press and hold your home button and power button until the device powers off. 

  3. Reset Network settings: Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset network settings

  4. Force quit the App Store app; double click your home button, find the app store app, and drag it up and out to kill it. 

  5. If on wifi: try Celluar; and the other way around.

  6. Reconnect to your wifi network; go in to Wifi settings and &#8220;forget&#8221; the network, before connecting again.

  7. Reboot your wifi router.

  8. View your AppleId; go to Settings &#8211; iTunes & App Store -> Click on your Apple ID -> View Apple ID. This is the one that solved it for me. It asked me to enter my password, and suddenly I was able to use the App Store again. 

  9. Restore your phone. This is the last resort. There are times when this is the only option.
