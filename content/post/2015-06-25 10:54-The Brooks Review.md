**Ben Brooks:**



> Even with the MacBook Air the iPad has a clear size/weight advantage. But with the MacBook that advantage is just not there. Not when you factor in the MacBook has a built in stand (the monitor sits up on itâ€™s own) and keyboard. 



I thought when Apple released it, and I still think that the new MacBook is a &#8220;iPad Pro&#8221; for people that want or need OS X or people that need some kind of like an iPad with a proper keyboard. And I think many people, especially writers should consider it as their computer, and those who need more power should consider this as their second computer instead of an iPad.
