**Ben Brooks:**



> And I think Desk is the right choice for people wanting to do basic blogging. 



Desk looks really good, it&#8217;s not for me though, for many reasons. The main one is that I use Jekyll, and I prefer to just use home made command line tools, plus a basic text editor to manage my site.



Desk is the thing for everyone that just want something basic; except for Squarespace users; since they don&#8217;t have a API yet.
