> Last month a veritable shit storm hit Twitter and many blogs, with the seemingly unwarranted attack on an anonymous blogger going by the name “Samantha Bielefeld”. This week I have been given a lot more information about this person and it makes me angry. Very angry.

    

> While I still believe gendered, and personal, attacks on anybody for their opinions is fully unwarranted, it has become increasingly clear to me I have misplaced my trust in this person. That misplaced trust was something this person appears to have been depending on and I regret this very much.
