title: "On updating passwords"

    I assume that you are doing the only sensible thing and are using unique and complex passwords everywhere, and have a good application to manage it like for example 1Password or LastPass(they are the only ones I recommend).

    I’m a big fan of updating passwords on a schedule. And I’m also a fan of doing it maybe once or twice a week with a cap on how many passwords you update. 1Password has a brilliant audit section that show you all the passwords you should update. I first update anything in the Watchtower section, then duplicate and then old, starting with the oldest. But I do not do all of them at once. I do it once or twice a week and never more then 10 passwords per day. The reason is that the passwords will turn up again at the same pace as you change them. This means that if I take the first Monday of the month and change everything that needs to be changed, then I’ll end up with the same backlogs six months from that Monday.

    If you instead change up to 10 passwords on every Monday and Friday, then you will never end up with more than 20 passwords that needs updating; except for Watchtower and duplicates.

    Doing all of it today, will only solve parts of the problem.
