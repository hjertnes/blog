title: "The minimalist home screen."

I can&#8217;t promise anything, but I think this will be the last one about home screens I&#8217;m a while.



One of the requirements I set for apps on my home screen is that I launch them every day. Or at least five days a week. In other words, every day I&#8217;m doing something more productive than listening to podcasts or audio books.



My home screen is usually not full. And I do this for a very important reason. Few apps there, makes it easier to find the app I need.



Give it a try. It makes my day to day life much easier. And I think it could make yours simpler too.
