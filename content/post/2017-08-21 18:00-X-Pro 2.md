    I loved my X100T, and I love my X-Pro2, but it is a little bit too small when I walk around for hours after hours shooting non stop. If you are going to get one accessory for your X-Pro 2 or X100 then I’d get a thumb rest.

    The basic idea is that you are this little piece of metal to the flash hotshoe, that extend a curve against the right side of the camera. Giving you a surface to rest your thumb on. The result is a more ergonomic experience, if you have larger hands.

    The good thing about smaller cameras are that they are smaller, easier to have with you everywhere, while the bad thing about smaller cameras is that they are way less ergonomic in many ways. Or I do at least think so.

    I added one of these to my X100t, and it made it much more comfortable to use. And I did the same with my X-Pro2. I either had to do this or add a larger grip. I personally prefer this because it doesn’t make the camera larger, while giving me more or less the same thing.

    You&#8217;ll find cheap ones, and you&#8217;ll find expensive ones. They do more or less the same thing, and both work. The more expensive ones are much better; the paint don&#8217;t rub off; you don&#8217;t have to use a screw to secure them. I use the ones made my Lensmate (order them directly if Amazon won&#8217;t ship them to your location).
