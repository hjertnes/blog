Relay.fm is Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett&#8217;s new podcast network. All of Myke Hurleys shows was moved over from 5by5. All, except for The Pen Addict have a new name. And he also started a new podcast with Casey Liss.



I wanted to write about it, the day they launched; 18th of August. It didn&#8217;t happen. The short story is that I spent a whole week being sick, and last week was just insanly busy.



[Relay.fm][1] is a fantastic podcast network, with great shows. You should check them out.
