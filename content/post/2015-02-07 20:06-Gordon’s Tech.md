**Gordon&#8217;s Tech:**



> There’s no iOS backup feature.

    

> Yeah, I hear your scoff, but iCloud Backup is not Backup. It’s a system clone. If you delete Contacts accidentally, you can’t readily restore Contacts of, say, 3 days before. When my sister accidentally deleted most of her contacts she had no way to restore them from iCloud. 



Yeah, we need real backup. What we have is not good enough, but still better than nothing.
