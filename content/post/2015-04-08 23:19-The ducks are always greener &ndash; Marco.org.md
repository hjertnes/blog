Marco is another DuckDuckGo convert. It seems like 2015 is the year when a lot of people move away from Google as their search engine.



DuckDuckGo is more or less as good as Google. And everyone that are uneasy about Google should switch.



I&#8217;m so glad that Apple finally added support for the search engine in Safari on both iOS and OS X last year.
