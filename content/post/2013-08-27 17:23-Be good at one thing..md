title: "Be good at one thing."

There is this cool and unique, hot dog shop, here in Bergen. It&#8217;s very old school and there is almost always a line. I can&#8217;t eat there since I am a vegetarian, but I really enjoy the concept.



And everyone I know that have eaten there, love it.



First things first, this is not the kind of store that have every single thinkable fast food thing you can think about shop. I&#8217;ll guess you have them all over the world; 20 types of pizza; and kebab, burgers and everything else.



This little shop have a few different kinds of hotdogs, and jus the classy kinds. I don&#8217;t think they have anything with bacon. I think there is either ten or under ten different types of sausage there.



When you jump on to the &#8220;toppings&#8221; or whatever you want to call them, I have seen a development during the last ten years, where people for some strange reason put on from ketchup to potato salad or even shrimp salad on their hot dogs.



This shop don&#8217;t do any of that. You can onion, either raw or the crunchy kind, ketchup and mustard; that&#8217;s it.



And when it comes to drinks; you can get a glass of juice for free, if you want a coke or something; well then you have to go and get that somewhere else.



The thing I like about this shop is not the food, but more the concept. The guy that runs it have been able to distil what he is trying to deliver down to the purest and most core and true to itself experience possible. And people like it.



There is nothing I love more than the kind of businesses that you get the impression that they have found the one thing they are and want to be good at.
