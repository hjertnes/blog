title: "Why WordPress Should Be Your Only Choice — The Brooks Review"
---

**Ben Brooks:**



> I’ve been a long time defender and lover of WordPress, and I could recount some pretty terrible stories of things that have happened to me, or people I know, running WordPress. The thing about WordPress is that it is big, like really big — it’s used everywhere. And it has gotten a bad wrap in nerd circles, mostly because it used to be that a link from John Gruber would bring a WordPress site to it’s knees. 



There are a lot of really good points there. I&#8217;m not a huge WordPress fan, it&#8217;s a good CMS, it isn&#8217;t for me.



There aren&#8217;t one reason why I use Jekyll, and there aren&#8217;t one reason for why I don&#8217;t use WordPress or Squarespace; but the key reason is that my workflows for managing Jekyll is way more efficient.
