I used to listen to a lot of different podcast, I mean a lot! And I still do, don&#8217;t get me wrong. But I have realised during the last six months that I need to cut down on the listening, to get through the amount of reading and writing I need and want to do each day, week and month.



Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I still love podcasts, and I would love to spend more time listening to podcasts. But I don&#8217;t work as a full time developer anymore, and I found a lot easier to combining debugging, writing code and sysdmin stuff, with podcast listening.



I use Day One to keep track of stuff. And this was no exception. This is what I do. I open Day One, when I skip a show, I add a new entry &#8220;Skipped podcast so and so, episode number that. &#8221; and add a few tags like for example &#8220;podcast&#8221;. Now, I will unsubscribe if I see that I have skipped the last three episodes of a show. Let&#8217;s face it, there are show I listen to every single time without exceptions. While there are show that I listen to most weeks. And then you have the shows I really like, but I don&#8217;t have the time anymore. There are of course also shows that have changed a lot since I started to listen to them.



One last note. There are shows that I want to keep track on, so I keep them in my RSS reader instead of my podcast client of choice. The reason for this is that it is a lot easier to scroll past a few pages on rss items, than to download and then remove podcasts. And if I see some episode that I want to see from a past show, then I can just huffduff it.
