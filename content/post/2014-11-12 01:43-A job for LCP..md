[Launch Center Pro][1], is one of the apps I just never got started with. I have had it installed on my phone more or less all the time since it launched. But I have never found a use for it.



One of the things I have done, and still do a lot on my phone is to launch a few different sites. Everything from every few days, to many times a day. These are sites like [Facebook][2], [Fastmail][3], my university e-mail address, and a few other university related sites. The common factor for all of them is that I need [1Password][4] to log in, but I don&#8217;t want to stay logged in.



I might be lazy. But I hate typing those URL&#8217;s all the time.



My solution to the problem is to use LCP as a glorified bookmark &#8220;launcher&#8221; for 1Password.



The problem with my needs and LCP was, and is that the there are not much between what [Drafts][5] + [TextExpander][6] or [Editorial][7] + [TextExpander][6] can do, that LCP would be a elegant solution for.



Check out LCP if you look for a fast way for opening a predefined set of urls in 1Password.
