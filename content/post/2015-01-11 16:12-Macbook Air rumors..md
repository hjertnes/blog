title: "Macbook Air rumors."
---

There have been a lot of talk about the recent Macbook Air rumors lately. Both [Jason Snell][1] and [John Gruber][2] have written excellent posts about it.



The Macbook Air is my favorite Apple device. It delivers something magical. You get the best battery capasity possible. And you also get a very capable laptop, with all the same ports and power that you get in the more expensive retina models. The only difference I see between the two is the screen and power. There are a few tasks when you notice it. Photoshop, Lightroom, Logic and Xcode. But it&#8217;s enough for almost everyone.



The rumor presents soemthing new. I don&#8217;t think it is something that could replace the current Macbook Air line; and I really hope it doesn&#8217;t. It seems more like something between the iPad and 11&#8243; Air. There should be a cheap and very capable entry level mac; the 13&#8243; Macbook Air is that. You have everything from USB to a SD slot.



I don&#8217;t think this rumor will lead anywhere. And a keyboard case from Apple, with a full sized keybarod that made it feel more like a laptop would be a lot more interesting that this.



Some people really want a Macbook Air with a retina screen; I&#8217;m not one of them. The retina models are more expensive, and their focus is a fantastic screen and more power under the hood. While the Macbook Air have another set of priorities; good enough, price and battery.
