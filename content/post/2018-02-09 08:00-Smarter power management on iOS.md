title: "Smarter power management on iOS"
---

Power management on iOS is usually pretty great. But there is one one thing that always drive me nuts. This is not a huge problem before your phone gets older than a year and the battery starts to degrade.



Anyways.



I take train to and from the office more or less every single day. Usually 3-5 days a week. And the receptions is poor most of the time. The way phones work when it is poor is that they start to increase the amplification of the cellar antenna to do everything in their power (pun intended) to get a connection. This means that your phone will use a lot more battery when the reception is poor.



This is how it works, and I don&#8217;t have a huge problem with it in general. It&#8217;s fine to do this if this is a place you only travel once or not that often. But when it comes to a train ride that I take every day, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fine.



Apple knows where I am (GPS) and they know the reception is bad. How about learning that there are no reception here, and only re-try once a month or something?
