> The Photos Video Field Guide is a 2.5 hour screencast that teaches you how to install and use Apple&#8217;s Photos Application and sync all of your photos between your Mac, iPad, and iPhone using iCloud Photo Storage. Managing your photos with multiple devices has, over the years, come to feel like chasing a mythical white whale. Not anymore. Photos delivers the goods and this screencast teaches you how. 



Check out the latest Field Guide from David Sparks, if you are using Apple&#8217;s new Photos app.
