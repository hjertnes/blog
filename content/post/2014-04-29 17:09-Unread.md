Unread is a great RSS reader for iPhone. I have been putting it off for a while, due to my impression that it was only for people that didn&#8217;t use Instapaper. Oh man was I wrong.



Ben Brooks put out a great [article][1] about it today.

This is spot on. It&#8217;s not as easy to send stuff to Instapaper, as it would be with for example Reeder. But I still think it is more or less the perfect RSS reader for iPhone. It makes it easier to read the shorter articles right there. While I still have the opportunity to send the longer articles to Instapaper, even though it takes another click.



> At the end of the day, Unread has won me over, as it is just too pretty to not use. Watch your back Reeder. 



It&#8217;s a beautiful app, with a fresh aproach. I just deleted Reeder from my phone.
