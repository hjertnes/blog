title: "My office setup"
---



I try to keep my office setup as limited as possible. Because I don't want too much stuff that might keep me from feeling productive when I don't have them available. 



My office at home and office at work have a few things in common. 



- Apple Magic Keyboard

- Apple Magic Keyboard

- LG 27" 4K USB-C screen

- One USB-C charger

- One Lightning charger cable, connected to a outlet

- One Micro USB cable, connected to a outlet

- One Apple Watch cable, connected to a outlet



And that's it. I just connect my MacBook Pro to the USB-C cable to charge and connect the screen. And I have all the charger cables I need.
