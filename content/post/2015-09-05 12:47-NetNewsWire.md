The development of the new NetNewsWire have taken forever, but it looks great, and I can&#8217;t wait to test it out.



NetNewsWire is a giant, and is for many, including me the first RSS client I ever used. I&#8217;m not 100% sure if having a proprietary syncing backend, instead of using FeedWrangler, Feedly, etc are going to work in 2015.
