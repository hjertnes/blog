title: "Should I buy a new iPad?"
---

I don&#8217;t think any of the new iPad models was much of a surprise for anyone that have been following Apple for a while. I think the only surprise was that they renamed the iPad.



Most intelligent people expected the iPad mini to get a retina screen, and they also expected the big-iPad to get the design of iPad mini.



It is no surprise that I still use iPhone 4S and iPad2. And I don&#8217;t think I will buy a new iPhone before I either can&#8217;t update to the most recent version of iOS, or that I break it.



But. The iPad is different. I have not decided if I should buy a new iPad or not, this year. My main problem with the full sized iPad is that it is too close to the size, weight and batter capacity. The 12 hour battery life on my 2012 Macbook Air, is more or less everything I need, most days. But, I also carry my iPad most days. The reason for this is to have something to write on, if I need to do something when my Macbook Air is dead.



Since my iPad will continue to work as a pdf-reader, writing device and preferred place to do my OmniFocus weekly review â€“ I don&#8217;t think I will buy any new full sized iPad in a while.



This leaves the iPad mini.



The reason I consider the iPad mini, is that it would be nice to have a small, iOS device with recent hardware that I can fit in my jacket. And this device is also something I can fit in a stand and use a full sized keyboard with. Like for example: &#8211; [Origami Workstation][1] &#8211; [Apple Wireless Keyboard][2]



Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the full sized iPad is great for writing. It is a great device to write on, if you place it in some kind of stand. But, I don&#8217;t think the full sized iPad is that great to write on, while holding it.



And my experience with the current iPad mini is that it is an iPad, with a weight and size that reminds more of the iPhone; which makes it great to thumb type on, while still having the great power of the iPad-platform.



In other words. I will probably buy an iPad mini, in the coming months.
