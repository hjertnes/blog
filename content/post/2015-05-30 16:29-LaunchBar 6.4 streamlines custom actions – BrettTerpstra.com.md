Looks great. But, I&#8217;m staying with Alfred.



This is the great thing about Alfred, you don&#8217;t need any custom API&#8217;s or anything like that. You can just drag and drop stuff, and use more or less any script with it. One of the reasons I got really into Alfred, and never got into LaunchBar or QuickSilver is that Alfred is uncomplicated by design, while the others required an investment I wasn&#8217;t willing to do.



It is good to see that LaunchBar are trying to make it easier, but they still have a long way to go.
