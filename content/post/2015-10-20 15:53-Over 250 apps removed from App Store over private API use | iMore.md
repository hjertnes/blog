title: "Over 250 apps removed from App Store over private API use | iMore"
---

> Several apps on the iOS App Store have been found to be using private APIs to collect device and user data thanks to a third-party advertising SDK. Apps that utilize the Youmi SDK have been found to be collecting data on a device&#8217;s installed apps, the platform serial number, peripheral serial numbers, and the user&#8217;s Apple ID. It looks like 256 apps were found to be doing this, though according to SourceDNA, who spotted the issue, they likely didn&#8217;t know what was happening.
