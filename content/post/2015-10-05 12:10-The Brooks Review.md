> One new feature in El Capitan is the ability to auto-hide the menubar. Like with the Dock auto-hiding, the menubar only appears when you move your mouse to where the menubar should be. When I found the option during the beta period, I immediately turned it on and have not looked back. Itâ€™s one of the best new features of OS X. 



I agree, this is one of the best new things in El Cap. I have a lot of things going on in the Menu bar, and that is great when you need it, but I also find everything that isn&#8217;t related to what I&#8217;m doing a distraction, and the only way you could hide the menu bar in previous versions of OS X was to go into Full Screen mode. I think Full screen mode is great, but it isn&#8217;t always the right choice.



It is great to finally be able to auto hide it.
