This is both good, and bad. I think the random selection thing is good for WWDC tickets, but I think I would prefer some other selection process for something like this.



Either hand-picking developers, or giving developers that have submitted Apple Watch apps to the store.



It is not perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.
