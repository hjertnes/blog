title: "Helm vs Ivy"
---

Helm and Ivy are the two big systems for doing "completion" in Emacs. Both of them are supported by Spacemacs. 

They do more or less the same thing. It helps you to do what you are trying to do, either by completing a M-x command or figure out method names or class properties when you code. And a whole lot more. 

I have used both, and the differences are minor. Helm is a little bit more full featured and always does what you expect. While Ivy is faster and more minimal. 

I'm going to stick with Helm, because I'm so used to it, and I think it is a little bit easier to work in in certain areas. For example the M-x auto-complete are much better in my opinion. But, if you want something smaller, something faster or prefer something more minimal I think Ivy is a good option. And I would be perfectly happy with Ivy, if it was the only option.
