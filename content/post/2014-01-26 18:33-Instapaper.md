title: "Instapaper"

I was sitting the other day and reading through my Instapaper queue, and I realised that something had to change. Instapaper have always been the place I go to read, and I just add anything that seems interesting. One of the problems with this strategy is that it might take a week, and it might take six months before I get to any article I add.



The result was that I came up with a set of three question, that I&#8217;m going to apply to anything I add to Instapaper from here on.



  * Would this article be interesting in three months?

  * Is it something I&#8217;m going to read, and not just &#8220;skim&#8221;?

  * Is this something I both enjoy and find interesting?



I think and hope that the end result after using these rules for a while will be fewer, but better articles in my Instapaper queue. But also a more enjoyable experience in general.
