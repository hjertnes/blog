title: "Is Apple Music Anticompetitive?"
---

I have defended Apple&#8217;s 30% cut many times in the past. But this is a area where I think they are wrong. Apple should be able to get a cut, and a cut that is larger than what credit card compaines get, but I still believe that services that are in direct competition with Apple, like Spotify, Kindle, or Dropbox should be able to get more than 70% and they should be able to link to other means of purchase than iAP.
