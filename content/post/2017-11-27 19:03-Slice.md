Slice is a method on the Array Prototype that you can use to extract a section of a array. Let&#8217;s say you want to remove the first two elements from a array. Then you could do something like this:

You could of course do the same with a combination of filters and map without using slice:

There aren&#8217;t much to the slice method, but the key thing is that it doesn&#8217;t mutate the array you run it on, but rather it returns a new copy. It takes two arguments: begin and end. If you don&#8217;t give it a end it treats the end as to the end of the array. And you can give it a negative number of remove things at the end. For example, like below to remove the last three elements at the end; without doing some weird .length hacks or double reversing.

Slice is a very versatile and useful method, when you need to modify a list based on position instead of content. And it much more elegant than some of the other solutions I have seen (and written) to get the same thing. Everything from something like my map + filter hack above to some more advanced uses for the old school for loop.
