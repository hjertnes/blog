title: "Goodbye Squarespace"
---

I&#8217;ve been playing around with a few different content managing systems during the last few months.



Let me start with saying the following. Squarespace during both version 5 and 6 have been great to me. There was a long time where I had nothing to complain about. And I think Squarespace is the perfect platform for someone to get started on. And I don&#8217;t think I would have continued to write my site for this long, haven&#8217;t it been for Squarespace.



The reason I left is that there have been a few things I want, that they haven&#8217;t solved since the public beta days of version 61. The two major remaning ones have been real MultiMarkdown support and a public API.<sup id="fnref-0"><a href="#fn-0" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>



I moved back to WordPress today. There are many reasons for me picking WordPress, over many of the other CMS&#8217;es out there. The three main reasons have been:



  * Scaleable hosting solutions like WPEngine

  * Plugins for close to anything

  * Apps like Poster for iOS or MarsEdit.



I went for a solution that just worked back in 2011; now I&#8217;m going for a solution that works the way I want it to work. That includes third party apps, my preferred markdown flavour and most important – me writing scripts or apps when or if I need them.



Squarespace have been good to me. And I still think it&#8217;s the best place for anyone to start, if they just want to get a website or start writing online.
