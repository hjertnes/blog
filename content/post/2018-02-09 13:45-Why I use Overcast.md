title: "Why I use Overcast"
---

I have been using Overcast for all of my podcast playing since the day Marco released it. And while I have tested out other apps since then I have stayed with Overcast, for the same reason I stayed with Instapaper all the time I used a dedicated read it later service (I use Pinboard these days). The reason is not about features, because most of the apps have more or less the same features these days. But instead it is about the design of the app.



Overcast has great design. But it isn&#8217;t the most beautiful app, and it isn&#8217;t a turd either. There are four widely used podcasting apps on iOS, as far as I can see. Overcast, Podcast, PocketCast and Castro. I have only launched the official apple app once, and I have less than zero interest in it. PocketCast is a great app, but the design is not my kind of thing. It feels way too much like a Windows or Android app for me. And Castro on the other hand is too much in the pretty over usability camp.



Overcast is minimal, but still looks great. And is very easy to use.
