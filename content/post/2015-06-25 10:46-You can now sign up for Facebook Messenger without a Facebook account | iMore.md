Interesting. I have been expecting this for a while now. Facebook Messenger is my favorite messaging app, especially after the [Messenger.com][1] web app came out. Messenging will be the next big thing after Social Networks, and Facebook knows that, and they are trying to get that market by allowing everyone â€“ Facebook user or not use their platform.
