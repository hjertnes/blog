title: "A few thoughts about the iPhone 8 camera"
---

The new "tele" lens on the iPhone 8 Plus is awesome. Even though I would consider it a normal lens and not a tele.



I'm not a huge fan of the portrait mode thought. It looks a little bit weird compared to the real thing.



But to have both a wide and a longer lens makes the iPhone a much more capable tool as a very versatile camera. Now we only need a real tele lens I'm addition and a setting to default to the one you prefer.
