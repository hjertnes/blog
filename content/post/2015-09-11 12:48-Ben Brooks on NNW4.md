> The biggest difference with NetNewsWire and most RSS services is that your Mac or iPhone is the device polling the RSS feeds for updates. Whereas with services like FeedWrangler a server sitting in the proverbial cloud is polling those services. This means that hitting refresh in NetNewsWire can take minutes as it has to check each feed for an update — whereas hitting refresh in with FeedWrangler will take seconds as it just has check with one server for updates because the FeedWrangler servers have already polled the RSS feeds. This is a dramatic difference in functionality. (The NetNewsWires cloud sync is just to sync subscriptions, bookmarks, and read states.)

    

> And thus, it feels like stepping back a decade when using NetNewsWire. All of a sudden not all of your feeds are updating at once (sometimes they time out), and you are constantly waiting on the refresh to happen — basically shit is getting screwed up all the time. I had several instances where all the feeds would update and forget read states, showing over 3,000 unread items — other times no new items would show up despite FeedWranlger showing new items. 



I&#8217;m sticking with FeedWrangler, and Readkit on OS X and Unread on iOS.
