title: "Why I shoot film"
---



I shoot both film and digital. And I use them for very different reasons. 



When I want to make sure that I end up with some good images I always bring my X-Pro 2. I can shoot duplicates and make sure that I at least have some good images at the end of the day. No matter how the lighting conditions are. But I often bring my 35mm camera instead if I just want to shoot for fun. 



If you go for a film camera you can more or less anything. I personally prefer very manual cameras, but you can also get something that are more like a modern DSLR or a point and shoot. The reason I prefer manual cameras is that they just work, even without a battery. And you just expose and shoot. This process is a very useful to really understand how light and the different settings on your camera works together. 



The reason people shoot film vary. Some do it because they like the process, others like the simplicity and some because of the look of the films they use.



I shoot film because I enjoy having some stuff in my life that don't require me to re-charge the batteries all the fucking time. And I really enjoy how the images look. Good black and white film looks much better than anything I have ever gotten out of a digital camera. And I really love how goofy Fuji Superia colour film look. Some do it with filters, I personally prefer to go back to where the Instagram filters or Lightroom Presets go their looks from in the first place.
