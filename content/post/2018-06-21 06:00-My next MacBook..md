title: "My next MacBook."
---

I think my MacBook Pro is something like a year and a half now. And it still works pretty great. Except for the keyboard. There are many things about this machine I don't like. But there are also some stuff that isn't good enough. 

What I don't like:

- Not enough USB-C Ports
- No SD slot
- Nothing like MagSafe

These are things I'd love to see fixed. And it would make the computer more usable to me. But they are in no way a "must". But there is one thing Apple have to fix: the keyboard. I don't love it. But that's not the point. It is unacceptable to have a unreliable keyboard on any computer. I don't care if it costs $50 or $3000 the keyboard should be reliable. Your computer sucks if it doesn't. 

If Apple doesn't fix the damn keyboards on their MacBooks in the next couple of years, I think I have to either go for a Hackintosh setup or a Linux + iPad setup. Because I'm not buying another laptop with a unreliable keyboard.
