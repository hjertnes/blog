title: "Looping over an Object"
---

<div class="kg-card-markdown">

  There are two ways (that I&#8217;m aware of) to loop over an object in plain Javascript; either use the for in syntax, example number one below, or by using Object.keys, see example number two.</p>

  <p>

    I personally prefer the fist method, because it involves less typing, but the second example might be easier to understand, if the developers on your team aren&#8217;t familiar with the difference between for in and for of.
