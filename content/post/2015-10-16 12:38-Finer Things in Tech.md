> Over the past decade of my career, I’ve used so many writing apps that you’d turn blue in the face if I listed them all. From MacJournal to Byword, 1Writer to Quip, they’re all really good for their intended uses. But for my general writing needs these days, I’ve settled on Ulysses for iPad and Mac from The Soulmen. It’s just damn good. 



I agree, Ulysses is fantastic for everything longer than a few hundred words.
