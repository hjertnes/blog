> Marked 2.5—a major update to my Markdown preview and writing tools collection—is now available for direct purchase and from the Mac App Store! It’s a free upgrade for all Marked 2 customers, and available at a discounted $11.99 for new customers right now. 



Great update, for a great app, I use it almost every day, to preview and export markdown files to PDF.
