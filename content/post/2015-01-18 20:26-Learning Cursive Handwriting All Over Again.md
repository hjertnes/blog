> My history with New Year’s Resolutions is kind of sketchy. Some years I’ll be somewhat vague and sort of proclaim I’ll exercise more, eat healthier, worry less or something else not very specific. As one would expect, those types of ill-defined resolutions aren’t very effective. Some years I’m very specific. Many years ago, I decided I would no longer eat donuts (I know, what was I thinking?). The donut ban stuck for four or five years until I cracked for some amazing donut I don’t even remember. This year I’m going to be very clear and finally do something I’ve been thinking about for quite some time. I’m going to relearn cursive. 



I might do the same, one day.
