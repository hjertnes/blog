title: "Amazon, paperback, ebooks & authors."
---

I&#8217;m not a huge fan of how Amazon are doing at the moment. While I do agree that ebooks should be cheap.



Here is the thing. I talked to a Norwegian author a few years ago, and he told me that the six months where the hardcover book have the monopoly is the time when he makes his living. And that is important.



I don&#8217;t have any problem with either waiting six months for the paperback or the ebook, or paying a premium on the ebook until the paperback is out.



Writing books are hard. And we need sustainable pricing models to make sure both the authors and publishing industry can make a living.
