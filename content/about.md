Welcome. 

I'm Eivind, I live right outside Bergen, Norway with my dog, girlfriend and daughter. I work as a senior systems developer at Knowit Experience. Where I mostly do front end development in React and back end development in C# on dotnet core. 

When I don't work I hang out on IRC, [mastodon](https://dog.estate/@hjertnes) and [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/@hjertnes). The little spare time I have I try to use on shooting pictures, working on hoppy projects in golang and svelte.
