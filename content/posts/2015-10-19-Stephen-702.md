Stephen Hackett have written two posts about the new Notes.app:
[Notes on
Notes.app](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/10/notes-on-notesapp) and
[Notes.app
follow-up](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/10/notesapp-follow-up).

I think the new Notes.app is a giant step in the right direction, and
Evernote need the competition to make sure that they make their app good
again. But I'm sticking with my current nvALT setup for a while, at
least until I see the thing Brett Terpstra is working on to replace it.
This is why:

-   Dropbox sync is in my experience faster and more stable than iCloud;
    and I'm more confident in how to manage conflicts etc there.

-   I have other ways to deal with the extra stuff Notes.app brings to the
    table, like for example TaskPaper.

-   At least 90% of my notes are just a lot or a little text, nvALT and
    iOS text editors are way better at searching for and managing that
    than the notes app; and I love Markdown.

-   I don't want something that is as important as my notes to be on a
    yearly update cycle.
