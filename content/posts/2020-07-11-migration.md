My [wiki](https://hjertnes.wiki) have been my main website for a while now. I'm in the process of migrating the content of this blog over to it. I just removed all the "status" or "micro blog" posts. The next steps would be to go over everything and re-write it as something on my wiki for everything in the archive. It won't be a simple move but a longer process and probably many re-organizations in the process.

The purpose of this blog moving forward will be my Likes posts and writing about changes and updates on my wiki as I publish them
