Sometime when I am working on some really difficult writing, I end up
with nothing; or it seems that at the first glance.

I have been working on a argument analysis for my studies for large
portions of the day. The stuff I have written is unusable; but it is not
for nothing. You don't need to write something good every time, you sit
down. You just need to move in the right direction.

I know what and how I am going to write tomorrow; and that is the
important thing.

But, if you used the whole day on writing and ended up with nothing. No
usable writing and no idea where to move your focus to something
greater, then it would be bad. Really bad.

The whole thing is about moving in a better direction. It might not be
the perfect direction; but as long as you keep moving against the goal
-- then you got something.
