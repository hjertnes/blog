Interesting, very interesting. Squarespace is great, but I think it's a
little bit too much for people that just want to write. And I think
there is enough options for people that want something self-hosted.
Everything from WordPress to my beloved Jekyll. But there aren't enough
good options, when it comes to hosted solutions. Typed looks good,
really good.
