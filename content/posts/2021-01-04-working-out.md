First day back and work, so this kind of feel like the first legit day of 2021. 

I lost 17kg last year, and I hope to loose even more this year. I'm very happy about getting back into good habits early in the year. So I re-started my calorie tracking routine today and I went for a run. Not as long as I was when I took a break before christmas, but not that far off.
