IDE's are not my kind of thing, but if it is, then I think
[Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) is four you. It is a plugin for
[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). IntelliJ is without a
doubt the best Java IDE I have ever used, and I have spent some time
using Cursive, you know, just to give it fair shake, and it is great.

Some languages need more IDE like features than others. Java and C# are
two of them. I'm not 100% convinced that Clojure need all of them
though. They might be nice, to you do not need them. Check it out if you
are looking for a powerful Clojure IDE, it is the best non-Emacs Clojure
experience I have seen.
