I have never bought any app bundle for as long as I can remember. Some
of them have great value. And you might get a lot of value out of them.
But I'm not a fan.

First of all, I try to only buy apps that I really need.

Secondly, I want to pay the full price for them. The reason I believe in
paying for products and services, is that I want the people behind them
to continue the development and support.

And the third reason is that I don't want to get a handful of apps that
I don't need or want.

The next time you see a bundle where you get $400 worth of apps for $50,
think about it. How much would it cost to get all the apps you want? And
how sustainable is it for the individual developers?

Go and buy a great app!
