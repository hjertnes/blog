I left Instapaper a year and a half ago. For various reasons, the most
important one was that there was some weird issues with the app that
seems to be solved now. Long story short, I used the app like normal for
a while, but after a certain number of articles it was just "blank", and
then I had to force quit and start it again to continue.

After Instapaper I tried Pocket, still I hate how that app looks. I
really hate it. Then I just used Pinboard for a long time. Before I got
back to Instapaper when it became available again after the GDPR
problems.

The reason I came back is that Instapaper has a reading experience that
is better than everything else. And that is what matters the most.

I still think the having all your links in one place archive aspects of
Pinboard are interesting, and I continue to import all of my stuff from
Instapaper to Pinboard a few times a month.
