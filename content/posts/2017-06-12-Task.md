My task management system is constantly changing in order to adopt to ever changing requirements from my side. My system has consisted of three different components (the later years), except for during periods when I have been experimenting to figure out where something trives or not. They are: a central database, a notebook and a “smart system”.

The central database is usually based on having one or multiple “Taskpaper” documents. It’s just a simple format to write down projects and tasks in a plain text file. It feels a lot like using a notebook. I use it because I is very easy to automate and copy past stuff into. This is where I store everything at some point.

My notebook (currently a Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal), and I use my own bastardised version of Patrick Rhone’s Dashplus system. My notebook is where I keep what I am working on right now. The perspective is never longer than a couple of weeks. And I also use it when I need to plan something. This is because I prefer just taking a notebook and sitting down at Starbucks or what ever and figuring out everything I need to do in order to complete something.

The reason I use a notebook to keep track of what I am doing now and the following days is that I find in much less distracting to have a notebook open than to having to switch applications all the time to figure out what’s now and what’s next.

Then you have the “smart application”. I currently use Things, and I have used more or less any application available in the past. I mostly use it for repeating tasks and stuff where I need to be reminded.

How strictly I’m following the stuff above varies a lot. There are times when I use taskpaper to deal with stuff I usually use a notebook for, and there are other times when I use a notebook as the central database. While other times I mostly use Things.

But the only thing that is constant, except for the three elements is the fact that I’m willing to let my system live its own life in order to solve any short time problem I might have, and then bring it back to its ideal form as soon as possible.
