What started as a exploration into alternatives to Lightroom ended in a
place I did not expect. I checked out Luminar and Capture One. Capture
One wasn't really for me, and Luminar is impressive, but the app itself
is worse than CC. I enjoy what both Lightroom CC and Luminar can do with
their AI technology in terms of tuning the image into something a lot
better than the out of camera RAW file. But the apps are horrible. I
have given CC close to two years, and I've had enough.

The thing I have decided to do is to shoot JPEG+RAW. Store the RAW's for
later, if I need or want to. And just put the JPEG's into Photos. I'm
not going to touch the RAW's; except for when I want to change film
simulations, and then I'll use the Fuji RAW Studio.

What I have done this weekend is to export all my RAW files out of
Lightroom, export all my JPEG's out of Lightroom (I'm about 50% done
with that), then I'll delete my library and delete all the Adobe apps
from my stuff and cancel my account.
