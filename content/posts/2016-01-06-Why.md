  The first thing you should be aware of with steel nibs is that, in general, they are stiffer than their gold counterparts. Makes sense, right? Gold is a softer material, so that translates to a softer nib. Standard gold nibs have some bounce or springiness when writing. Steel nibs are firm without much give. This holds true for the full range of nib sizes too. Extra fine to broad all exhibit the same general behavior.

Finally someone bringing this up. My personal opinion is that they are both good, and have equally good properties. I personally prefer to write with a gold nib. But I think my hand writing look better when I write with a steel nib.
