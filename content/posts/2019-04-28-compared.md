The KUM Masterpiece (or the KUM longpoint sharpener, it is basically the
same thing) and The Classroom Friendly are my two favourite pencil
sharpeners. The former is a inexpensive, small sharpener while the
latter is more expensive and not very portable. Both of them give you a
great long point.

I use the Classroom friendly most of the time because it is a lot
faster. But I also use it because I prefer the point it gives me. It is
not as sharp as the KUM's give you. Some people might think that is a
bad thing. But I don't, because sharpness is only a good thing if it is
actually usable. And I think that the super sharp point the KUM gives me
break too easy and sometimes tear the page.
