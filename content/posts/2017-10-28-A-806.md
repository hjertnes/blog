The new "tele" lens on the iPhone 8 Plus is awesome. Even though I would
consider it a normal lens and not a tele.

I'm not a huge fan of the portrait mode thought. It looks a little bit
weird compared to the real thing.

But to have both a wide and a longer lens makes the iPhone a much more
capable tool as a very versatile camera. Now we only need a real tele
lens I'm addition and a setting to default to the one you prefer.
