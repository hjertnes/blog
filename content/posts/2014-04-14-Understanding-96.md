I don't know about you, but one of the reasons for me writing is to
understand myself.

You have an idea. And then you try to explain it.

What you have is something that is kind of clear in your own head, but
won't make any sense for anyone else.

This is what writing is all about.

Writing is about explaining that idea -- telling the story -- in a way
that someone else would understand.

But, writing is also something different. It is also about understanding
yourself, and what you are thinking.

Sometimes I write to tell the world what I am thinking. And other times
the process of telling the world, is also my preffered method to figure
out what I think and what I mean.
