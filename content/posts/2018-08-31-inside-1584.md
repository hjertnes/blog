I first played this game on iOS, then I bought it again when I got my
Switch.

It is beautiful and great. It is kind of a side scroller meats puzzle
game. There are probably a whole category for it that I don't know the
name for.

This is not an easy game, and it is great, but a little bit more on the
frustrating side than I prefer.
