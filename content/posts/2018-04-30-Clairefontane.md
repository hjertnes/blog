[I received the Clairefontane Flying Sprit Notebook
free of charge from Tudos.no for the purpose of this review.](https://tudos.no).

This notebook is amazing. There are no other way to put it. When I look
at a Rhodia Webnotebook I see the best designed version of the A4
softcover notebook that Moleskine popularised. This on the other hand is
the perfect design for the soft cover version; you know the kind you can
buy in a three pack.

The design is very understated, and you don't think much about it
straight away. Before you start to realise how perfect everything is.
Even the stitches on the back are beautiful.

Let's move over to the paper. The paper is very similar to Rhodia(same
parent company), but my impression is that it is a little bit smother.
There are smaller differences between this and Rhodia, like there are
minor differences between Leuchtturm1917 and Rhodia, but they are very
minor. And I would put them in the same ball park.

This book came with a lined layout, and I like it a lot. The lines are
broader than I'm used to from Travelers Notebook refills and
Leuchtturm1917; they remind me a lot about the layout I used in school.
The kind you usually find in most wire bound notebooks.

The Flying Spirit is a fantastic notebook, that I would recommend to
anyone that like notebooks like the Moleskine Volant. It is in many ways
a much better version of that. With better paper and higher quality
production standards. I'm not going to get another one of these, because
I prefer a hardcover notebook, because it is a little bit easier to
write on them for example when I take the train to work, and don't
always have access to a good table. %
