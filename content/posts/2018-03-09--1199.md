I've updated [oldpub](http://github.com/hjertnes/oldpub) to work with
the MarsEdit file uploading and updated
[micropub](http://github.com/hjertnes/micropub) to work more elegantly
with proper token validation through IndieAuth.

Oldpub is tailored to make it possible to use MarsEdit with static site
generators like Hugo, and Micropub is a Micropub server for generators
like Hugo.

The former is done as far as I'm concerned. It pretends to be Wordpress.
Micropub on the other hand is something I intend to put more work into,
and to make it a full featured micropub server.

Both are written in Python 3 and Flask.
