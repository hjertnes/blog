Most emacs power users would probably agree with the statement from the Emacs Manual about Emacs being more of a computing platform than just a text editor.

If you know a Emacs power users you have probably noticed how we sometimes try to move stuff to emacs that seems a little bit weird to do in a text editor. Like reading email or rss feeds. Those are two of the things I recently have moved back into emacs.

When something works in emacs I really love doing it there, because I prefer having as much as possible in there because it makes my workflows and setup a lot easier. But if it doesn't work that well there I just get rid of it. One example of something I want to do in emacs that doesn't work at all is browsing. And one thing I don't do a lot in emacs is shell stuff, because I haven't really found a good enough way to do it.
