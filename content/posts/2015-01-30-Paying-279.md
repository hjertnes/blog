iMore is a great site, and Peter Cohen's NSFW is fantastic. I don't get
a lot of requests like this, but I have gotten them in the past.

One of the core principles of everything I do is that I would rather not
make any money at all, than making it in a scammy or dishonest way. It's
just wrong for a web site to charge for writing about a product.

Your readers need to trust you; ads or memberships are fine. But you
can't loose your integrity
