When you build a product outside of a MVP mindset you define what you're
trying to make. And then you make a list of features that makes sense
based on that. But also based on what people expect to have there. Back
in the day we all always expected to be able to import and export data
in all online services.

But when you are doing things like an MVP and follow incremental
improvement, instead you try to find what are the minimum we can make
that are useful to our users and that give them enough value to continue
using it. And then you start adding features based on feedback and where
you see pain points.

This means that a lot of "obvious" features will probably never make it,
because they are nice to have, but neither you see the pain points or
the users ask for them enough.

I'm of the mindset that some features should be there, not because you
need them or because people want them, but rather because it is the
right thing to do.

It is interesting to look at the effects different ways of working can
have on your product.

As always, the most important thing is do build stuff in a way that
makes sense to you. If something would annoy you if it wasn't there, add
it.
