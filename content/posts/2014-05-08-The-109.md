My favourite internet person, [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com)
launched a new website. [The Cramped](http://www.thecramped.com) a few
days ago.

The Cramped is site site about analog writing. Pens, paper, notebooks,
and even typewriters. It's without doubt the site I have been spending
the most time on since it launched.

I think it's great. Interesting links and good articles.

Check it out!
