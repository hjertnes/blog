I love using Apple products. And I don't think I'll go back, to Linux.
And I would never go back to Windows. But I do have my concerns. The
hardware is excellent. But the software quality have been on a steady
decline since Snow Leopard. First OS X, and now iOS. I really hope they
will get their act together.

-   They need more engineers.

-   They need to focus on smaller releases

-   They need to do less, better.
