I could not agree more. Doing what Ben Brooks calls the "CGP Grey"
method, or what I have done on and off for a very long time is great.
Some people prefer organizing apps in various folders or app screens. I
prefer having the stuff I use all the time on my Homescreen, and having
the rest in a folder; and then just search for what I need. The having
three icons in the dock and a empty row is weird, but everything feels
so much nicer when you do it.
