I got this Nock.co case as a part of the 2018 PenAddict Kickstarter.
This is not something I would have ordered myself, because it is very
much outside of what I usually use. But I like it a lot.

The basic concept is a small case with room for two pens and something
"business card" sized. This could mean proper business cards or index
cards in that size. Something Nock.co sells. So I ordered some of them
and started to use this thing.

The Talluah is a must if you are a index card person. And if you like
me, are not, I think it can be a interesting addition to for example a
pocket sized notebook. There are things where I think Index Cards work
better, like capturing stuff or as a blunt instrument when there are a
few things you really need to get done. But I prefer using a notebook
for lists and stuff like that.

Index Cards and a Talluah have been a good addition to the stuff I
carry, and I will continue to use it.
