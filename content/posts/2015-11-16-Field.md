There are many things I love about Field Notes, but there are one thing that is more amusing than anything else, and that is the inside of the backside of the cover. The Practical Applications section. It is such a fantastic combination of good ways to use Field Notes to the most funny and amusing applications ever. All of them are good ways to use the notebooks; some of them are formulated in a more serious tone than others.
