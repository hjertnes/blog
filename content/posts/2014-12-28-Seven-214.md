> Before he was a big game hunter, before he was a deep-sea fisherman,
> Ernest Hemingway was a craftsman who would rise very early in the
> morning and write. His best stories are masterpieces of the modern

> Hemingway never wrote a treatise on the art of writing fiction. He
> did, however, leave behind a great many passages in letters, articles
> and books with opinions and advice on writing. Some of the best of
> those were assembled in 1984 by Larry W. Phillips into a book, Ernest
> Hemingway on Writing. We've selected seven of our favorite quotations
> from the book and placed them, along with our own commentary, on this
> page. We hope you will all--writers and readers alike--find them
> fascinating.
