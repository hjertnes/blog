Pomodoro is my favourite productivity hack, when I really really really
need to focus and get a lot done, in a very short time. I use the
technique all the time, when I have pressing deadlines, or is preparing
for exams. The basic principle is that you set a timer for X number of
minutes that you work, and then you have a set number of minutes that
you have a break. And after four rounds(or what ever you want) you have
a longer break.

I have been looking for a good app for doing this for as long as I have
owned an iPhone. But it wasn't before today that I actually found one I
liked. Most of the former apps have been a bit too much for my taste.
They were either very ugly and hard to use; or too much. I don't want my
pomodoro apps to have stuff like task management. I just want a clean
and simple interface to do the pomodoro stuff, and a easy to understand
settings page to set up number of pomodoros(rounds) before a long break,
and to be able to set how long each timer should be.

[Pomodoro
Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-timer-focus-on-your/id703145045) is the app. It's priced $1.99 at the app store.

You should get this if you are like me, and want a pomodoro app that is
just that -- a pomodoro app. It works great and got a decerving slot at
my homescreen within an hour.
