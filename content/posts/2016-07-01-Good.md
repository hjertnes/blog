I’m writing this with my first fountain pen. My Pilot Metropolitan. A pen that I have used and abused for over three years. And it have been on the short list of being replaced for a while(Just waiting for Gulet to get the colour I want back in stock).

My only real complaint about it is the lack of nib options.

This is not the kind of pen I expect to last forever, like a Lamy 2000 or a Pilot Vanishing Point. But it is still one of the ones I enjoy the most. And lasting forever isn’t really the point.

There is something to buying a good pen that lasts for the rest of your life. Btu there is also something to going for that cheaper option that is good enough. Just get a few of them, and replace them as they wear down.

A Lamy 2000 is a good if not excellent pen, while a Pilot Metropolitan is good enough.

Neither is right or wrong. It just comes down the personal preference, and budget.
