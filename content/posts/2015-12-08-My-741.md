I started a new pen blog a few weeks ago, it had at that point been in
the words for a few months, and in the planning a few months before
then. The motivation for spinning the occational pen and paper posts out
of this site is simple:

-   It didn't really fit in with the rest of what I was doing here

-   It frees me up to write more about pen and paper related topics,
    because it has a proper home.
