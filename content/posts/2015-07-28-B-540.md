My primary head phones since 2010 have been my Bose QC15, for many
reasons, mainly, they are comfortable, easy to maintain(change cabel and
cushions) and audio quality. But I have been consicering bluetooth
headphones for a while; mainly because I'm sick of chaning cables. And
the P&W P5 is on top of my list. I love Marco's insane headphones review
page. It is great for when you need to see if something is good or not,
and what is good or bad about it
