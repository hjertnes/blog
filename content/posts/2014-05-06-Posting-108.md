I completed the move to [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com/) last
night. It feels great to complete a project I started to think about In
the end of last year. I chose to go with wordpress for a while, until I
figured out what I wanted to use long term. And I ended up on Statamic.
It's not a pure static engine, and I might move to that at some point.
But it has a lot of the cool stuff from systems like Octopress. No
database, only static files.

There are a few reasons for spending $99 compared to the free
alternatives. First of all: I don't need a corn job to generate the site
when something changes. But the most important reason was that it was
so. UVB easier to get started with Statamic compared to Pelikan,
Octopress etc.

But that's not what I was supposed to write about here. The first things
I wanted to figure out after completing the change was: how do I post
from iOS?

The short answer is FTP. The slightly longer answer: Editorial and Diet
Coda on the iPad. I don't know what I'm going to do about the iPhone. I
could use Textastic, but I think I'll just wait for the iPhone version
of editorial.

I found a great editorial workflow for uploading over rss at
[MacDrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/08/ftp-upload-with-editorial.html).
