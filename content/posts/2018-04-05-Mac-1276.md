I often see people saying "X is solved with Y on OS X, I hope Apple will
support it", and I'm pretty sure that it won't happen at this point.
There might show up something like Y that solves it, but it will not me
the same. And probably not as flexible.

That's just how it will be.

iOS is not the kind of computing I enjoy. And I will hopefully be able
to work on a UNIX system or a UNIX like system for a very long time. But
it is not the future.
