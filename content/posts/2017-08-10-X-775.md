I have spent some time, but not that much, since I got my X-Pro 2 figuring out what kind of lenses I want to get for my new camera. And this is one of the good things about not having a mount like the Canon EF which has history going back to 1987 where you have numerous generations of lenses from both Canon and <em>many</em> third parties. You can literally spend days if not weeks researching and comparing primes of one specific focal length.

My current lenses are the 35mm F2, which is the lens I shoot the most with. And then you have the 50mm F2, I was going to sell it, but I have decided to keep it, because it is long enough for when I need a longer lens, while at the same time being wide enough to be useful if I’m going out with just that lens.

Then I’m going to get the 23mm F2, following the trend of doing for lenses that are not too extreme to be a single trick pony.

With the 23, 35 and 50 I’ll have everything I need, and all of them are focal lengths I’m very used to.

Then I’m pretty sure I’m also going to get Samyang 8mm F2.8 fish eye, because I have always wanted one. And while being a manual lens and not that “useful” I always think very distorted images are cool and fun.

And the last lens I’m going to get is another 35mm, and that is the Mitakon F0.95. One of the lenses I have always wanted is the Leica 50mm Noctilux, it’s indulgent, heavy, cost the same as a fucking car but the images look amazing. The Mitakon isn’t <em>that</em> expensive, but it is a manual lens, and I want it for when I’m shooting in darker situations. My personal experience is that autofocus isn’t that useful in the dark anyways.

This puts my plans to save for my dream camera(A Leica M6) on hold for a while, but I will on the other hand have all the lenses I need and want.
