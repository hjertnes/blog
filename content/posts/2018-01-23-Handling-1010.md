With React 16 handling errors with React became a hell of a lot easier
than it used to be. The official
[documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) has
all the code you need to get started.

The basic idea is that there is a lifeCycleMethod, and if there is an
exception thrown in any component in this or somewhere "under" this
component it will trigger. With all the information you need to display
an error message to the user, or more important saving it somewhere.

Showing it to the users? Not that important, because most of them will
not ever read them. Having a place to keep track of them? Very
important, makes it so much easier to fix and deal with all the problems
with your app; instead of just those you hear about.
