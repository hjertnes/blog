Every now and then I consider ditching digital photography and move over
to just shooting analog.

And I think I would, if two things would happen: cheaper film and
someone would start to produce mechanical SLR cameras with lenses again.
Something like my Nikon FM.

Why? Because analog cameras are so much simpler. They almost never run
out of batteries, and when they do I can buy new ones at a grocery
store.

I know Leica still makes analog cameras, but that is a little bit too
expensive for me. And I think there is room for someone to make cameras
like Canon and Nikon did at the end of the 70s.
