I think it will be harder and harder as we move forward to pick the iPad
or the MacBook. Apple have on one side made a laptop that is very
similar to the iPad, and on the other side they are making iOS 9 more
powerful, which makes it more like OS X.

The big questions in the future will be about what you prefer; keyboards
and operating systems.
