I decided in the end of December that I had to do something about the
ridiculous amount of e-mail I'm receiving. So, I decided to re-start
something I did a few years ago: Unsubscribe from one thing every week
day.

My hope is that I will notice a decrease in the e-mail noise over the
next few months.
