I have met the podcast surplus many times over my life, and how many I
listen to go up and down, depending on, well my life. Podcasts is my
current favourite entertainment, and it isn't a problem with a long
backlog, as long as the majority of the podcasts isn't something that
goes out of date(news); there is always a situation where you are going
to complete it. And the same thing applies to Instapaper queue.
