> Help Brad and Myke record live and in-person at the 2015 Atlanta Pen
> Show!

Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley of [The Pen
Addict podcast](http://relay.fm/penaddict) launched an interesting kickstarter. They are trying to
raise money for Myke to travel to the Atlanta pen show, and for them to
record a live podcast from the show.

Great podcast, and interesting use of Kickstarter.

Check out the podcast, if you haven't!
