The Field Notes Pencil. It is actually awesome. This pencil belong on my
Top 3 list, together with the Golden Bear and the 602. I have gotten a
few of them for free with various Field Notes orders over the years
without paying much if any attention to it.

This is a round pencil with a #2 core. This means that it is great for
writing and really comfortable to write with. It give you a core that is
smooth, but not so soft that you have to sharpen it all the time. And
the round case makes it very comfortable to hold. It is the most
comfortable pencil I have used. The core is great, but I prefer the
Golden Bear core. I'm not sure why, but it feels a little bit smother.

Anyways. A fantastic pencil that everyone should check out.
