I just finished a pack of Blackwings, and I'm back with the Golden Bear.
And I really love this pencil.

Having a soft pencil feels really good, but my personal favourite is
something a little bit firmer close to a HB. And the GB is just that.

It is not expensive at all. You could get 15 blackwings or 144 Golden
Bears.

The thing I love about it is that it is a really good pencil, similar
quality to the Blackwings, but it is not as nice. The result is that it
is a lot cheaper. That means that it is easy to just carry a lot of them
without it feeling very expensive.
