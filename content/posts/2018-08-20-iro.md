I got myself a new ink back in July, because I was running out of inks.
This is another Iroshizuku ink, because I have kind of decided to mostly
use them exclusively going forward. I'm not saying all other inks are
bad. But my experience is that I enjoy using them much more than almost
all other inks I have used. They dry fast and I never have any flow
problems.

It has a great purple colour. Like with all Iroshizuku inks I have used,
it is not too dark or too light. There are not much at all to note about
the ink. If you like inks from Pilot Iroshizuku and want a purple one
I'd give it a shot.
