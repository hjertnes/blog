You have probably done the same thing. A few times through your life; if you are like me, and like to get quality products. You have to justify it. Either by necessity or value. That means, necessity: you either need to expensive one to get your stuff done, or it will make it easier, value: it might look more expensive but you will save money in the long run.

I have stopped or I do at least try to not do it anymore. This is because I think that buying quality is a virtue by itself.

Cheap products often entails things that we don’t like, that we at least shouldn’t like.

A quality product is almost always more expensive to buy, compared to a cheap one. This means that it is easier to do the right thing; if they want to. Like giving people a decent wage, make sure it is sustainable and make sure it is a good quality product.

You can go out there today and buy one of almost anything that isn’t related to technology and use it for the rest of your life; if you buy a quality product and take proper care of it.

If you buy a good pair of boots in your early 20s, and take care of them, you’ll probably save a fortune by time you retire. More expensive at that point, but it becomes cheaper and cheaper for every year that passes.

Yes, money and value is important when you come down to it. But I consider that a bonus; or one out of many things that is great about it.

  Less waste

<li>

  You support local and non-local, small and large businesses that focus on doing the “right” thing.

  They usually look and work much better.

  You take a stand and tell the world that you actually care.
