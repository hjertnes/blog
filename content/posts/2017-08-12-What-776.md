If one would pick the three most influential camera’s in history, I would say the Leica M3, then the Nikon F4 and last the iPhone. The reason is that the M3 basically invented 35mm photography and how cameras looked and worked up until the SLR; the F4 is the prototype for how SLR’s looked and worked from it was introduced up until today. And nobody thought of phone photography as anything but a gimmick before the iPhone; not the first one though. Probably the 4S?

If you look at the Leica M series from the M3 up to the M6, you see a camera that has just what you need to create. Combined with build quality that makes it possible for cameras made in the 1950’s through the 1990’s to still function today. The reason is that Leica continues to service them, and all of their modern M mount lenses are still compatible and neither the batteries nor the film is proprietary.

There have been a few attempts at making digital Leica M’s- But I’m not convinced that we have seen the first true Leica M. There are a number of reasons for this. Most of all because they are too much like a digital camera and not enough like a true M.

If you pay $8000 for a camera, then you either expect the best technology on the market or something that is built to last. All analog Leica M’s were expensive new. But that is fine if you can use it for over 60 years when its maintained properly.

I think that a Leica M digital camera should look and work like a M6, except for the thing that advances the film and the thing you use to rewind it. Those can we just get rid off. But the rest should be the same.

There should be a “analog” counter like you have on a M6; but it should show how many more pictures there are room for on the SD. And it should use standard batteries you can get in any photo store.

The view finder should not require any form for batteries, and the only parts that should use battery power is the sensor (when its in use), the light meeter and the counter thing I mentioned above.

But. If this is a camera that is going to be useful in 20 years, then they need to be clever regarding the sensor. A 24MP Full frame sensor is probably good enough for the nest 5-10 years for most people. But I still think they should be upgradable. Send it in to Leica to get the latest generation “M” sensor in it. Just like a M3 from 1954 can use the latest in 35mm film technology.
