I love Netflix, not because their content is the best ever. It's not,
what they do is not like HBO who always want to make the stuff that
everyone have seen like HBO or Sons of Anarchy. Some of their shit is
not in the top tier, but most of their stuff is there or almost in the
top.

The thing I like a lot about Netflix is that they just want to make
stuff that make their investment make sense.

Like everyone else, they know that it is really expensive to comete with
HBO. So instead they play a different games.

A lof of my favourite stuff each year come out of Netflix, but most
people would probably hate it. But I like it a lot.

And that is a interesting point. Because you can still make something
very interesting from niches.

In the world of streaming most of the incentives that have been driving
TV up to this point are turned on their head.

If you have the money, and the ability to make sure it pays off, there
are no limits to how many shows you can produce per year.

In the old world of TV, ther were some limits, like the times when
people actually watch TV and the number of channels you had. Your main
goal in a streaming world is to keep people subscribed, while your main
goal in the TV world would be to make sure it made sense to have you in
their cabel packages.
