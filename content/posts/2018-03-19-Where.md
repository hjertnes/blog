Where am I going with pen, paper and so on in 2018?

Pens: I'm not sure, there are some pens I would like. But they are
priced way above my comfort level or never in stock.

Inks: I guess this will be where I start to experiment more in 2018 and
moving forward.

Notebook: I'm more or less happy with what I have, and I don't think
there will be that many changes here.

Notebook covers: I'm very curious of what Nock.co will come out with in
this area this year. And I guess a large portion of what I'll buy will
be coming out of Atlanta.
