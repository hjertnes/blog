I have used the Apple Sports band a lot with my Series 1 watch. And I
think it is great, for a rubber / plastic watch band. But I'm not a huge
fan of it, even though it is the band I have used the most. My problem
with it is that it is not the worlds most comfortable to wear like 22
hours a day. It kind of feels like your arm can't breathe. And unless
you tuck the end in the hole, it is very easy to unbuckle it. I don't
tuck it in there because harm hair.

The band I use most of the time is my Clockwork Synergy NATO band. It is
awesome. A standard buckle. Never unbuckles, comfortable to wear no
matter where and how. But it has one problem that the sports band
doesn't: it gets dirty.
