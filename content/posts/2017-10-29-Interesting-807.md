It seems like there is a change to how app updates work for apps that are in use.

The way it used to work was that if I for example were listing to a podcast using Overcast, and hit update all, the app would exit when it was time to apply the update. And now it seems like the update will not be applied before the app exists.

I’m not sure how I feel about this change. On one side is it nice that the app don’t suddenly exists. But on the other side do I prefer that a “Update all” button does exactly that – updates all of my apps.
