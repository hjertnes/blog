Fantastic! I love notebooks that combine blank pages with either grid or
lines. Like the Field Notes notebooks from last year. The reason is
simple: I usually write notes in my notebooks, but there are times,
where a simple sketch is the most efficient thing, or when you doodle
during a meeting / lecture because, well it's boring.

I wish there was more notebooks like this.
