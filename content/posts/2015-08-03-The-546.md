Great review of my favourite planner. I use my every single day to plan
short term, long term and to keep a log of the highlevel stuff I was
working on.

I use the Hobonichi Planner, since it is the only one available in
English, but I would consider the others if or when they are available
in English.

You can use them for many different things. Some people use them as a
log, while others use them to journal, and of cource planning.
