I've put together this super simple shell script to make it easier to
update all your Arch User Repository packages:
[update-aur-sh](<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/5fa78829ef8104acf34479cff5c21517>).
The big if is that you need to check out all the AUR git repo's to one
folder, and just change the script to reflect where you place them.

I kind of wish there were some better built in tools to manage AUR
packages though.
