  What makes the Dialog 3 special is its twist retract/deploy mechanism. The nib deploys completely, a full and regular-sized Lamy two-tone gold nib, and when the nib deploys the clip draws close to the body of the pen, making it less obtrusive (especially when compared to the Vanishing Point clip).

What a fantastic pen. Take a look at the clip on this pen, compared to the Vanishing Point, that is the reason I think high end Lamy pens are the best.
