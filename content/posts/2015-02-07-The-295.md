I have been a huge fan of negative income tax, for a very long time. And
this article proves a lot of my arguments for it.

It is a great idea, you give everyone enough money for survival, and you
can remove many of the complicated welfare programs we have. And people
that would like more money, have to earn it.

The important part is: negative income tax. This means that you either
get all or parts of it as cash, or you get all or parts of it as a tax
deduction.

I think Switzerland is implementing something like this.
