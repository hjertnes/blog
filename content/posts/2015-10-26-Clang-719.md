> Clang appears to be following the same path that WebKit has. Apple
> switched over to Clang years ago and the pace of development of
> Objective-C accelerated immediately. A few years ago Clang became the
> default compiler for FreeBSD, displacing GCC. In early May Microsoft
> announced that they're Bringing Clang to Windows. According to The
> Register, Microsoft will have a release of Visual Studio that uses
> Clang as the front-end to their compiler in November.
