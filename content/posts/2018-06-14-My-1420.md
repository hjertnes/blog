I started to use Emacs with Spacemacs, and loved it, and then I moved
over to Doom Emacs when it started to feel slow. And then I moved over
to having my own thing when I realised that the kind of changes I wanted
to make would be much easier if I went 100% custom. This is not the
first time I tried this however. But nothing went anywhere the first
time I tried it.

The reason I wanted to write my own was that I wanted to make sure my
editor had less moving parts, and only had what I used. Instead of
having a huge system for managing configuration and a lot of stuff I
didn't use. I'm very happy with it this far. It starts faster than Doom
Emacs with a little, and faster than Spacemacs by a lot. And I can set
stuff up in a way that makes the most sense for me.

The hardest thing about it was to identify the various packages or
combination of packages that provide a certain functionality in
Spacemacs and Doom. But everything worked like a charm after a few days.
