So, if you want a good retractable fountain pen, you have one good
option. And I have only seen one other option, which isn't that good to
be honest.

On one side you have the Pilot Vanishing Point and on the other you have
the Lamy Dialog 3.

I have a VP and I love it, even though it has some constraints. The
short version is that it is a special pen, where Pilot have made many
hard choices in order to get a pen that is as good as it is. But that
means that it won't be a good fit for many people. The biggest problem
with it is that the clip is kind of annoying for some people, doesn't
hold enough ink, and that it is a pain in the ass to fill when you ink
bottle runs low.

My impression when I was going to get a retractable pen, and spent
some(a lot) of time researching is that the Dialog isn't that great. I
might get one at some point, but not now.

Here is the thing: we need more retractable fountain pens. To get some
fresh blood and some competition in this market where Pilot and their
Vanishing Point dominates. I get the engineering problems with making
it. But I want more competition here. Because many people cannot use the
only good retractable fountain pen available, because of the clip.

It would be really awesome if someone started to sell the mechanism, and
then as a result a lot of different pen designs based on it.
