I bought my first fountain pen around three years ago. It was a Pilot Metropolitan, with what we today call the medium nib. There was no choice back then. Today is the last day I’m going to use it or bring as a part of my “everyday carry”.

I have used it a lot, the clip broke off, the nib is kind of bent out of place and the barrel is all scratched up. But I do love it for what it has become.

This does not mean that I’m ditching the Metropolitan, I got a new one to replace this one around six months ago, and will without doubt continue to be a part of my EDC in years to come. And I do love if for being the best al around “cheap” fountain pen out there, either for experienced or beginners.
