I constantly re-evaluate everything I use, everything problem notebooks & pens to apps and electronics. It is the only way to figure out what you need, what isn’t working, and what do I need to change to end up at something better.

It have been over six months since I stopped using Field Notes or any kind of “pocket notebooks”. I might get back into them soon. Not because the change I did in November was wrong per say, but that I think they might still be useful in some aspects. The reason I stopped using them back then was that they wasn’t the ideal fit for a majority of what I was using them for. But I realise now in retrospect that they still are useful for a tiny portion.

I don’t think Field Notes or any kind of notebooks of the same size are the best for managing your paper based getting things done system or journaling. But I think there is a place for them to keep small to-do lists that you need on the go, like grocery lists or to capture things when you are on the go.

The great thing about the format is that you can have a couple of them in your back pocket at all time, something that isn’t as easy with a Travelers Notebook; even though I almost always have a bag. It isn’t just about the size, it is also about how much easier it is to take out a small notebook from your pack pocket and a pen from your front pocket.

I’m a strong believer in leaving stuff behind in order to figure out where their place actually are. This means that you need to try something different and stop using what you were using, to see where the old thing was better, and where the new thing is better.
