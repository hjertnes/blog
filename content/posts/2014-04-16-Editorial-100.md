[Editorial
1.1](http://omz-forums.appspot.com/editorial/post/5900430768865280) information.

This is amazing news. I really look forward to both the iOS7 look and
feel updates, and the _iPhone version_. I love Editorial. But I don't
use it much, and that's because of the lacking iPhone version. I love
the iPad, but my iPad is old. And the iPhone is without doubt the device
I carry everywhere. It's also the devie I use the most.

I would also love to have some kind of Editorial for OS X.

Great news, I can't wait for it.
