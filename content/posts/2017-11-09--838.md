Just got my my new Apple Silicone case for my 8 Plus. It looks good,
feels good, adds protection without too much bolk.

I personally think that Apple makes the three best cases for iPhone. The
Silicone and the Leather Case is without doubt the best general case,
and the Smart Battery Case is awesome; if you want a battery case.

Most of the cases I see out there looks pretty bad. Big and or ugly.

When it comes to the case or not question, I think that there was no
need for a case, unless you needed extra battery before the 6 and 6
Plus.

But I think you need one with anything larger than a 5. And the fact
that Apple makes cases for them, and not the 5 size or smaller speaks
for itself.

You can blame it on the size or how slippery they are. But the larger
phones need a case.

I used a red silicone case on my iPhone 6S Plus, until it fell apart,
and then I used a leather case until the phone died.

And I ordered a new silicone case a few days after I got my new phone. I
didn't really consider anything but a Apple case, because they are the
best.
