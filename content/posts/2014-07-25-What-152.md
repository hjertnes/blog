I just read the latest post on Randy Murray's site. It's called:
[Write
about your pain](http://whowritesforyou.com/2014/07/25/writing-assignment-write-about-your-pain/?utm%5Fsource=rss&utm%5Fmedium=rss&utm%5Fcampaign=writing-assignment-write-about-your-pain).

And that made think about that old Hemningway quote, at the top.

The thing I always do, when I'm depressed and low, is that I open DayOne
or a paper notebook, and I start to write about the things that really
scares me. Things about your past. Things you can't bring up -- ever. In
other words: what hurts. Write them down.

Learn to write without filters; it's good to get it out. That's what a
journal is for.

And Subscribe to [Who writes for you](http://whowritesforyou.com/).

You should also read some Hemningway and Bukowski.
