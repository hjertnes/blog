It only took me a little bit over four years, but I’ve given Rhodia another shot. I tested them out back when I was too shy to bring fountain pens with me outside my flat. So my “outside” pen was my first Retro 51. And I thought the dry time with that pen on the Rhodia pads was horrible. It felt like I could take a cigarette break between each page.

But in retrospect, it wasn’t that bad compared to something like for example tomoe river. So, I ordered a dot grid orange Rhodia Webnotebook from JetPens. This got to be the coolest notebook I have ever owned. The material of the cover feels almost like a leather bound book; soft and a little bit of friction.

The paper in this one is the 90g version. I have nothing bad to say about it. It is more bleed resistant than my Leuchtturm1917 notebooks, but also a little bit longer dry time. But I don’t think you will notice much of a difference, unless you are really sensitive to dry time. Switching to a finer nib or a faster drying ink would probably do more for your dry time.

This notebook is so cool, that I might consider using them as my “writing” notebook, instead of a Leuchtturm1917, but there is one major stopping point: I have grown to really love having multiple markers.

I would most defininently go for “webbies” if you the combination of great paper and the best looking and best feeling cover.
