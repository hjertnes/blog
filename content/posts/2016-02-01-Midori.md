  Fountain pens are built to last. They may run out of ink, but they can be refilled over and over again. The same thing can’t be said for notebooks. Pages are filled with everything from beautiful prose to grocery lists, and the tears and scratches that mar the covers are reminders of the journey. Once these books are their most worn and beautiful, we chuck them out or put them on a shelf to collect dust. I’ve been longing for a notebook that could acquire these beautiful signs of age while lasting as long as a good pen.
