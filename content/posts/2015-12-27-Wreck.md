  Enter Keri Smith’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399161945?tag=toolsandtoys-20">Wreck This Journal.</a></em> This journal literally commands you to “destroy” it in various and interesting ways, whether it’s ripping or poking holes in pages, painting on pages with coffee, flinging the book at walls, showering with it, drawing on it with glue, etc. The point is to get you out of your comfort zone so you can experience what the true creative process is like

I don’t have the problem at hand. But this is a fantastic book for everyone that thinks that their fancy notebook is too nice for their crappy writing.
