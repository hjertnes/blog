At some point I bought a bulb syrringe and a pack of two regular
syrringes from Goulet Pens. I think they are some of the most useful
tools I have as a fountain pen user.

A bulb syrringe is this rubber thing you can fill with water or air to
make it a hell of a lot easier to flush a fountain pen FAST. You could
do the same thing in the sink, but it would take a hell of a lot longer.

It makes it easier, and faster to clean a cartridge / converter pen, and
the result is that I do it more often because it it easier.

Then you have the regular syrringe. Or it is not like the one your
doctor uses, but it looks the same. You can't actually pierce your skin
with it because it is flat.

I use this syrringe for two things: refilling used cartridges in pens
where I consider the coverters useless. I'm looking at you Kaweco. And
for refilling converters, because I like to have them as full as
possible.

The cartridge part is self explainatory, you have empty one, so you take
the syrringe, fill it with water and stick the needle into the hole and
press water in until it is clear. Then you take out the water with the
syrringe, fill the syrringe with ink and then use it to fill the used
cartridge with new ink.

But I also use the same trick to properly fill my converters. This is
because if you fill them like they intend to they often are between half
full and 2/3 full. So I just fill them all the way up and stick them
into the pen.

I have links to the stuff I use below.

A short note about links and this site. I usually don't link directly to
product unless I feel like I have to. This might be because it is hard
to say something like "The Lamy 2000" and everyone knows what I am
talking about or because I got the product from free in return for my
putting up a link.

The reason I usually don't link is that when I do, and it is not
sponsored, I feel like I'm telling you to buy this thing from that shop.
Something I don't. I think that everyone should pick the place to buy
stuff from that makes the most sense for them.

This is why I usually don't link to products.
