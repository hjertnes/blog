Most of my focus at the moment are going into my wiki, but because I don't have or want a RSS feed there, I'll write every week or every two weeks here about the changes I have done there.

-   I took all my blog post drafts I had and added them to the wiki
-   Did some simple re-organisation. I'll probably do more of it next week.
-   Went through everything and updated it
-   And I'm also playing around with the non stable version of Emacs again, the upcoming version 27. It has native support for JSX and tabs.

The other big thing I have been doing this week is to take a break from Micro.blog, like I wrote about on Friday. I appriciate how supportive a lot of people were about why I chose to do that. I'm currently checking out [Mastodon](https://dog.estate/@hjertnes).
