I really love my newest pen, the CON-70. And, then, I got this idea
after a few days of using the pen. Damn, I want a Vanishing Point with
this converter. Like I have said many times, I don't think the 0.4 or
0.5 you can get into the standard converter is enough.

I usually can get through one or multiple days with that. Except for
when I en up writing a lot by hand. Then I run through the converter
_fast_. It's not about that, it's rather the fact that I hate to have to
worry about it. I never do with my Lamy 2000 or TWSBI pens.

The reason I worry is that I have filled it in the morning, and written
it dry before the day was over more than once.

Now.

A Vanishing Point with a larger converter, would mean that the pen would
also be larger, and it would be heavier. This would probably make it
even less accessible to women. And that sucks. But, I'm not saying
"scrap the existing one and make this one". I'm saying make this in
addition.
