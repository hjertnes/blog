What to do with the pictures I shoot with my iPhone was a big issue for
me, for a very long time.

I didn't want to mix them up with my DSLR pictures. They serve a
different purpose. They are more like a memory, than the pictures you
make prints from.

And I didn't want to leave them on my camera roll.

My current workflow is the following, I upload everything to Dropbox
with the app; I remove the pictures from my phone. And then, I go
through all of them and add the good or important ones to Day One.

The Dropbox upload is something I do a few times a week, while the
clearing out my camera roll is something I do about once a month. It's
difficult to answer how often I add the pictures to Day One, I do it
when there are a a few hundred pictures.

Then I just delete everything in the camera upload folder.

The reason I ended up with Day One, is because it's my journal. It's the
place I add everything personal and important. It's also the app I read
and browse in, when I don't have anything better to do.
