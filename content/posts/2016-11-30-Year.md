I think I have three or four drafts of this post in my notebook. My intent was to publish it on the day, but I have simply not had the time to get it done.

This site, and most other writing have to take the back seat while I try to complete my degree as fast as possible and try to get the startup I’m working at off the ground.

I feel really bad about not getting this post out in a reasonable fashion or time and I will try to get it done next year. I’m grateful and surprised over the response this site have received. Everything happened much faster than I had anticipated or hoped for.

There are also two people I have to mention in person because they gave me the initial push, and because I have been a fan of theirs for such a long time: <a href="http://penaddict.com">Brad Dowdy</a> and <a href="http://www.wellappointeddesk.com">Ana Reinert</a>.

The big question is: what am I going to do with the InkSmudge in year two? I’m going to revisit som of the topics I have written about during the first year, and I am also going to look more at ways to integrate stationary and a like into your life and how to be happy with five pens instead of 50.
