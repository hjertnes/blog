I recently got my first Field Notes order in a long time. It was three
packs of Pitch Black. It is the first limited edition I have bought
since Arts and Sciences.

It is awesome. The cover is thicker than usual. And the colour is
awesome, because the outside is black and the inside is like the
regular. I'll probably order another batch of them if there are any left
by the time I order more.
