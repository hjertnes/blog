One of my favourite things Microsoft have made in the last few years is
the OmniSharp Server.

The key to being happy about coding in languages like Java and C# is a
excellent auto complete engine. And this is what the OmniSharp Server
is. One of the reasons .NET have become so popular is that Visual Studio
is so good, and the best part of it is the Intellisense engine.

The OmniSharp server is a server or service that other IDEÂ´s and text
editors can use to integrate C# and F# auto complete. It is what Visual
Studio Code uses, and I have also added it to my Emacs / Spacemacs
setup.

It is a brilliant move. And I believe stuff like the OmniSharp server is
the future of good software development tools. Every editor shouldn't
have to implement the same thing. It should be just a shared server that
all of them can hook into.
