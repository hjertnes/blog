I spend most of my times these days: writing, reading and listening to
podcasts. But still, I wish I had more time to spend on them all. On
them all.

Anyway, I love the iPhone and iPad app for Instapaper, but that is not
the way I read the majority of all the stuff I add to Instapaper.

The device I prefer to read on is my Kindle. The reason for this is that
it is always in my coat pocket, and that it's battery life is so good
that I only need to charge it about once a month.

This is the trick. Once a month, I go into Instapaper, and start to
download the ten latest articles into the Kindle mobi format, then I
archive the 10 articles that was downloaded, and repeat this process
until my Instapaper list is empty. Then I plug in my Kindle into my
Macbook Air and transfer the files.

I sometimes read on my phone or iPad, but it is not often more than 1-2
articles. You know, I might start browsing through twitter or draft a
blog post, like I am doing now. But, when I read and only read when I
open my Kindle. If I spend two hours reading on my Kindle, I get through
about ten times what I could get through during a week on any of my
other devices.

This is one of the not that know features of Instapaper that every
Kindle user, with a Instpaper reading list that they new get through
should check out!
