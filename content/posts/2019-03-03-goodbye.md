I've posted about this earlier in the week on my
[Micro blog](https://hjertnes.social). But my mum had to let our
family dog of 11 year go on Tuesday. It was not a huge surprise because
of her age. But still very hard, and a lot harder for my mother. And
Luna will probably be very sad and confused when she can't find her the
next time we visit.

Tom Waits didn't want to grow up, Nemi never dit. It's great to see a
dog of 10 years old play like she was 1.
