WSL or Windows Subsystem for Linux is a way to run Linux under Windows with native like performance. I have used it some, and it is great, but there is no support for GUI stuff, and some stuff like fish just doesn't work.

I think it is really cool, and it would be really awesome if Docker on Windows (the linux kind not the one that tries to make Docker images of Windows software) would use it to run Docker itself.

But I miss some real integration between the two operating systems. Like being able to install a Linux emacs inside Arch and run it like a regular Windows app and being able to interact with both stuff inside the VM and things inside windows. If not it is mostly just stuff we have seen before, in a different package.
