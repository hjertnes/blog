I think it is great to see him go independent, I don’t think I would be into pen and paper haven’t it been for him & the podcast. Listen episode <a href="http://www.penaddict.com/blog/2015/12/15/the-pen-addict-podcast-episode-185-dont-make-me-cry-again">185</a> for details. It is strange that he have been able to do a podcast, a blog, have a family, a full time job and to be able to do <a href="http://Nock.co">Nock.co</a> at the same time. I can’t wait to see what he is able to do now that he does the blog, the podcast and <a href="http://Nock.co">Nock.co</a> full-time.
