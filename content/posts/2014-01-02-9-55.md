[Productivityist](http://productivityist.com) had a great post, with a
list of nine tips for becoming a better writer. I agree with most of
them. All of them are true, but one of them are a bit dangerous.

Again. A good list. I don't tend to read that many blog-posts containing
lists, but I'm glad I took the time to read this one. I have been
following all of the tips in it for a very long time. I think they are
useful for most writers and people that would like to get more into
writing.

Be careful: productivity should not be what you do, but what you are.
