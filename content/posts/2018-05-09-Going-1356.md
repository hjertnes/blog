I have pass a real shot, because I thought the idea behind it was
interesting: a command line program that is a front end to a folder of
GPG encrypted files. But I have gone back to 1Password because I felt
like it was a little bit too much friction. And my experience is that
password manager is an area where you want to workflows to be as easy as
possible to make sure that you actually use it.

The problem with pass was not the app itself, or the iOS app, both of
them was good enough. But the browser extensions was very unstable. I'll
probably check it out again in the future though. Ô¨Å
