I got this lovely green ink with my last order from JetPens. One of my goals for 2016 is to try out more different inks, especially as many as I can of the Iroshizuku inks. I have used black inks for as long as I can remember. The reason I love black inks is that I can use them for everything, and I personally think that black in general look much better than the “bic-blue”. This doesn’t mean that I hate all blue inks, but I’m not a fan of the lighter ones.

The two most important factors for me when I try a new ink is how it is to write with it & the dry time. Both of the Iroshizuku inks I have tried are excellent at both. It always flows wonderfully, and the dry time is short. What I mean by that is that the time it takes the ink to dry is short enough so that I never have to think about it. It is more or less the same as the black Iroshizuku, but slower than the Noodlers Baranacke.

I love this green colour. It doesn’t have the properties I don’t like about many light greens where it just looks too light and is hard to read. That means that it looks very good if you write with a finer nib. And it doesn’t have what I don’t like about many darker greens either, where it is just this very dark thing. This means that it looks slightly different with finer and broader nibs, and you get slight variations when you write with a stub nib. This is probably old news for most people, but I hadn’t experienced it much myself, because black is black.

It is fantastic ink, and I also look forward to trying out a few more Iroshizuku inks. I have another Iroshizuku bottle waiting for me. And I’ll probably order a few more the next time I buy something. Black will probably continue to be my primary colour, but I really enjoy to have a few pens with something different.

The thing I have learned to enjoy about the Iroshizuku inks is that they are very consistent; based on both my own experience and reviews. That means that how it feels to use them, and the dry time is more or less the same. And that is a fantastic selling point by itself, as long as it is consistently good.
