I thought it was about time to write another daily carry post. My
current ink is a Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki-shikibu, and I use that in
all the pens in current rotation.

My current pocket carry is the Belroy Cover + Filed Notes, some Nock.co
Index cards and a short pencil, when a pencil gets shorter than the
height of the case I take them out of rotation and use them for this
purpose.

I use my Nock.co pouch to carry pencils, I currently have some Golden
Bears, some Blackwing Volume 54 and some Blackwing Pearl.

I carry some new Field Notes, my Vanihsing Point and my Lamy 2000 in my
Hightower, and I also use my TWSBI Eco's, and Pilot Metal Falcon; but I
don't carry them. I use them from my desk.

The notebook situation otherwise are changing. I'm stilling working my
way through the last rest of my LT1917 stash, before I'm going over to
using travelers notebooks again.
