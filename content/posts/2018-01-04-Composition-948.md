Composition is a very important concept to understand if you are going
to write good and maintainable react code. Because React components can
be nested. What this means is that you can write a component where you
say "place everything nested under me here". You do this by using the
children property.

You might have a component for the basic layout of your app, and then
you place the router under it, telling it where you want the content to
go.

This is a very powerful way to write re-usable code; where you want some
to have the same stuff surrounding various different types of content.

Composition and Higher Order Components are the techniques I think are
the reason you can write a lot more with a lot less lines of code using
react; if you do it right.
