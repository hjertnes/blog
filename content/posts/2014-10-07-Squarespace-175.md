> Squarespace 7 is the result of a year-long effort to refine the
> simplicity of our platform while retaining its power. The biggest
> change you'll notice is in our interface; you can now make live edits
> in your website without switching back and forth between preview mode
> and your Website Manager, and we've annotated every editable element
> on your site to make everything easier than ever. We've also
> reorganized our menus to create a more intuitive experience overall.

There aren't many news that are more exciting for me than major updates
to the Squarespace platform. One exception might be iOS and OS X
releases. I can't wait to get access to the beta.
