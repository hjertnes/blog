One of the biggest powers, or deepest holes in TaskPaper is it's tags.
You are not limited to one. I have been trying to refine everything
against a more usable system than what I had thrown together when I
wrote the
[post](http://www.hjertnes.me/blog/-taskpaper-after-using-it-for-a-while)
after I had used TaskPaper for a month. My current setup have six
different tags, and a few others, that are only used to track different
kinds of stuff for the future; like my [@book](<https://micro.blog/book>)
tag, which I use to create lists in DayOne containing all the books I
have read during a year.

My current tag-setup is divided into two different categories, I have
three tags for scheduling, and three tags for OmniFocus like contexts.


## Scheduling. {#scheduling.}

My scheduling tags are @next, [@today](<https://micro.blog/today>) and
@tomorrow. One important note here is that nothing have anything close
to a strict schedule. They are just a guiding principle; but I try to
only schedule tasks that I actually intend to complete any given day.

The [@today](<https://micro.blog/today>) tag, is the tag I set on all
tasks I intend of hope to complete on any given day. While the
[@tomorrow](<https://micro.blog/tomorrow>) tag is all the tags I intend to
complete the the next day, and I just do a simple search and replace the
every morning to move them from [@tomorrow](<https://micro.blog/tomorrow>)
to @today. This is a simple hack, but it works.

[@next](<https://micro.blog/next>) is the tag I use the most. This is more
like a flag, than anything else. I go through all of the tasks in my
main TaskPaper file, and just add [@next](<https://micro.blog/next>) to
any task that I should get started on as soon as possible. That might be
today, it might be in a week. The reason for using it is to have a tag
to filter on when I schedule what to do today, or tomorrow.


## Contexts. {#contexts.}

Contexts are probably on it's own a very good reason to buy OmniFocus;
I'm not the hardest context user on the planet. But, I like to use them
on some stuff. Some people like to divide tasks into contexts like mac,
iPhone, iPad, home, work etc. I don't.

I have three contexts: @home,
[@university](<https://micro.blog/university>) and @hidden. The reason I
don't need or have ever needed contexts like computer, iPad or iPhone is
that I always have at least one computer where I can do most of the
tasks I need a computer to complete.

I try to avoid using contexts, unless there are a very good reason for
it. There are some kinds of tasks that isn't that relevant if I'm not at
campus, or at home. Like for example printing documents, I can't do that
at home, or anywhere except at the University. And I don't need to see a
lot of projects related to doing laundry or doing the dishes, when I'm
not at home.

Hidden is probably the only tag, that might be strange for some people.
This just a tag I use to hide tasks(and projects) that I don't need to
see right now. I have a lot of tasks in my main file, that won't be
relevant in a few weeks. I use [@hidden](<https://micro.blog/hidden>) to
hide them, until I need to see them.


## Use one tag. {#use-one-tag.}

One of the big problems with tags, is that you can use many of them, at
once. After trying different systems over the years, I always stride to
get away by only using one at the time. And I always live by the policy
of every tag having a purpose. There have to be some kind of filtering
purpose for using tags. Don't start using tags before you need them. And
don't be afraid of re-factoring your tagging system when you need to.
