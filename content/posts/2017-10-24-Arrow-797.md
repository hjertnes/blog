We use them all over, not just because they are shorter to write, but
also because they look cool, and you don't need to bind this for them to
work with this. I'm going to write about 'this' some other time. The
biggest difference between a regular function and a arrow function is
that the former has it's own 'this', which means that you need to bind
to 'this', if it needs access to it, while an arrow function on the
other hand shares it with it's parent. You can write an arrow function
in three different forms: expression, statements and object litteral.

A object literal is a way to use the simple form of the expression to make an arrow function return a object. It is this way because the object syntax {} would not work in an expression because that&#8217;s the syntax of using a full arrow function.

I use what ever variant that end up with the code that is the easiest to understand. I try really hard to use expression where ever I can. And to use Object Litterals when I need to return objects and to only to use a full function when it is the only way.
