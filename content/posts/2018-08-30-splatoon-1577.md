This game is so good. I love it so much. It is my favourite game on the
Switch. I love how goofy the paintball thing is. And nobody would
confuse it for anything that tries to make war or guns to look cool or
attractive. I'm not even going to try to explain the game, you should
just get it. What I love about it is that it is just the right amount of
frustrating. But it is never so hard that I feel like putting it away
and playing something else.

I have not, since I got it had anything else open on my Switch.
