I just installed [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump), and I
have no idea why I haven't done this before. The pitch is that it looks
at your history of commands using "cd" and tries to guess where you want
to do when you hit "j foobar". Just install it, configure it, and leave
it for a few days or weeks and then try to use it. It is awesome.
