There exists like a billion templating libraries for Javascript, and I
guess many of them exist mostly to get around the problem of: How to
generate html without doing that weird `"<h1>"+title+"</h1>"` problem.
It works fine for short stuff, but it doesn't take a lot before it
becomes too cumbersome for anyone to enjoy.

Template Literals to the rescue.

All _good_ programming languages have a way to do something like for
example this in C#

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/9e2251ebd109d3936f61ef3af446d99f.js>"></script>

</div>

This is where one of my favourite features in ES6 comes in, that I
always forget to use, because the plus hack is to ingrained in my brain
that I always forget to use it:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/7ba870df3043d928985256e90046e91b.js>"></script>

</div>

They are great, and could be used as a mini templating languages, if you
needs are too simple to include something like Pug or Handlebars; they
do exactly what they say they are, and work great. But I'm not the
worlds biggest fan of the use of ticks: \`. Mainly because it is kind of
weird how they are inserted into text files. Other than that, great.

I get why they didn't, but I kind of just wish they had broken the
String type and let us use ${} inside regular strings.
