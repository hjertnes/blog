Gabe of Macdrifter, writes a very interesting list of good podcasts. I
have heard about some of them, but there was some new and interesting
items. I write lists, and I don't mind them, as long as they aren't
"clickbait". A good and interesting list is good. They can be lazy or
good; this one is very good.
