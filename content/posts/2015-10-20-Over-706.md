> Several apps on the iOS App Store have been found to be using private
> APIs to collect device and user data thanks to a third-party
> advertising SDK. Apps that utilize the Youmi SDK have been found to be
> collecting data on a device's installed apps, the platform serial
> number, peripheral serial numbers, and the user's Apple ID. It looks
> like 256 apps were found to be doing this, though according to
> SourceDNA, who spotted the issue, they likely didn't know what was
> happening.
