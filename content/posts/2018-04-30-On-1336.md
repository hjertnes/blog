I have thought that you should chose how you implement your back end and
front end separate from each other, all the way since I started to form
the idea that all complex web development should be driven by static
resources plus JavaScript, instead of being server rendered.

How you implement a modern JavaScript application changes, and
sometimes, but not too often, it makes sense to start from scratch to
follow a more modern approach. This is why many teams have been moving
over to for example React the last few years. And the same goes for the
backend, you will find yourself in a situation where it makes sense to
move over to something else because your needs have changed. For example
because what you went with in 2010 doesn't scale that well anymore,
either because of performance or because of how large it have become.

The best way to make sure that these transitions go well is to keep each
part separate. And that the one don't know much about the other. If you
do that, it will not be that difficult to re-implement either part. If
you make sure that how the front end talk to the back end is the same,
or for the back end, as long as you make sure that the URL's and so on
are the same.

Keep them in separate repo's and treat them as separate projects, even
if the same people are working on both,
