I bought my first box of pencils not too long ago. And I think this is
the first time I have paid for a pencil. Why? I'm not sure to either of
the why questions. I have never bought a pencil because I didn't know it
was more to them than the crappy plastic thing I got at school, that us
boys always tried to bend into weird shapes. And I'm not sure why I
bought a box of them now. I guess it was because a lot of people I
respect enjoy using them.

My biggest surprise about pencils is how similar to fountain pens they
are. Everyone have their own taste. And you have a lot of the same
problems: both are very fiddly. Also: there are compromises. For example
a softer pencil is smoother, but you need to sharpen them more often.
Not unlike how broader fountain pens are more smooth(until you move into
stubs), but they require more ink and take longer to dry.

I have enjoyed the Blackwings a lot. And I use them a lot. They are
great to write with for example on the train and other places where I
don't want to think about ink smudging. They also look fantastic. Which
was kind of the reason I went with the regular blackwings. But I will
probably check out the 602 the next time. Because I think I will prefer
a pencil that doesn't require as much sharpening. But who knows? This is
new to me.
