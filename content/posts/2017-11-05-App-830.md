Finder is a pretty good file manager, not the best for everything; but I believe it is the best option for a majority of user for a majority of tasks.

There are two aspects of it in particular that makes it very useful in certain situations.

The first is that it does not close the window when a drive or CD is removed. This might seem like a minor thing, but it is a major pain in the ass when you are copying the contents of many different CDâ€™s, like I often do, when I get rolls of film back after getting them developed.

The Second is its dual browser. This is a very old feature, that used to be in more or less every file manager. Especially in the world of text based software. I remember to use it a lot in GNU Midnight Commander in my Linux days.

Path Finder is not as pretty as Finder, but it is the power user version. Instead of hiding useful but confusing features and information it is there, right in your face.
