So, I decided to finally write a emacs command to post to Micro.blog.

This is how it works: write what you want to post in a buffer, M-x
(space space) post2mb.

First, open a terminal and cd ~/.emacs.d/private && wget
[raw.githubusercontent.com/tkf/emacs...](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkf/emacs-request/master/request.el>)
&& wget
[gist.githubusercontent.com/hjertnes/...](<https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hjertnes/62f1acd0b85acb66755dd87c36401a27/raw/396402ae2385ccdc0c3426860d8220a5f7a7d3aa/mb.el>)

Then, open ~/emacs.d/private/mb.el and find the following line :headers
'(("Authorization" . "Bearer")), you need to add a app token after
Bearer; make sure there is a space between Bearer and your token.

Finally you need to open your spacemacs config: ~/.spacemacs, find the
user-config and add the following two lines to it:

(load "~/.emacs.d/private/request.el")

(load "~/.emacs.d/private/mb.el")

Restar emacs an you should be set. Just open a new buffer, start writing
and hit SPC SPC post2mb when you're ready to post.
