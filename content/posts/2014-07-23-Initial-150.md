I think the initial sync is my main annoyance with iOS these days. It's
the fact that's it's such a hassle to do it. I'm not talking about the
apps with a small data set, like for example 1Password; but apps like
Spotify and Evernote.

I know there are a lot of both battery, performance and other issues
with having something like this. And I don't think it's a huge issue.
It's just a pain to do both initial and larger syncs.

The whole process of turning off auto sleep, plugging in, opening for
example Evernote and letting it stand there for a few hours while
syncing. It's not elegant. And even worse, it's impossible to explain to
non technical people.

You can do better Apple.
