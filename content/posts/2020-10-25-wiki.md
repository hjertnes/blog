I brought my [wiki](https://hjertnes.wiki) back this week. It kind of went offline when I went from roam to org-roam. But this week I found some time to write the stuff needed to generate it.

It is generated with [this](https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/wiki/tree/master/build.sh) script. It takes all my org-roam notes that doesn't contain "#+private: true" and converts them to HTML with pandoc. And then [this](https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/wiki-index-builder) go program makes the index page.

None of it is fast, but it works. The plan is to do a weekly update.
