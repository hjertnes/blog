I finally got my invite to [Micro.blog](https://hjertnes.micro.blog)
in the end of October. And I got to say: it's awesome.

Micro.blog feels a lot like what App.net felt like, and a lot like
Twitter in the old days.

I would encourage everyone that miss those times to check it out. It
feels very beta at the moment, but it will get there.
