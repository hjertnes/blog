This is both good, and bad. I think the random selection thing is good
for WWDC tickets, but I think I would prefer some other selection
process for something like this.

Either hand-picking developers, or giving developers that have submitted
Apple Watch apps to the store.

It is not perfect, but it is a step in the right direction.
