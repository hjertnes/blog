When you choose what programming languages to use for your project you
should take in to consideration if developer productivity or reliability
is more important.

For example if I develop the backend in Python and Django I'm much more
productive, but if I use a programming language such as Java or C# I get
a much stronger type system, which are catching more potential problems
during compile time (if you are using it correct).

Having a strong type system can help you a lot, which means that it
helps you to make sure that you don't add a number to a string variable.
But that means that you need to use more time declaring what type a
variable has. But on the other side you often have to add more code to
make sure that your data structures have the correct content in dynamic
languages like Python.

And having a strong type system is also very helpful when you refactor
code.

On the other hand, languages like Python often requires far less code
than C# does.

It doesn't matter that much on the end result, but my experience is that
having solid automated tests are very important when you use dynamic
languages. And I think there are something very comforting about letting
the compiler doing the first round of validation.

This is by the way one of the big advantages of using Swift instead of
Objective C.
