The year is almost over. And I thought I should compile a list of the
apps I really love. iOS is the platform where I find the apps that I
love. There are many great OS X apps, but I never feel the same kind of
affliction for them.

-   **[DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com/)** is my all time favorite app. I
    don't think there is anything out there that have given me a similar
    joy. Or that I have spent more time in. I journal every day. And I do
    it in DayOne.

-   **[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)** is the app that
    gives me peace of mine. And keeps everything together for me. I store
    everything important there. There is nothing even close to 1Password.
    It was one of the apps that got me to buy an iPhone; similar to that
    Textmate got me to buy an Mac.

-   **[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone)** is the
    only calendar app that makes sense to me. It's simple to add events
    and it gives me a simple and easy to read overview. It's the calendar
    app for people that don't use or like calendar apps.

-   **[Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/)** is like FieldNotes. I
    use it to write down stuff, because it's simple, fast and easy. Then I
    move it to somewhere more appropriate, when I have time.

-   **[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)** have become my go
    to writing app. I even prefer using it over my Mac, when I need to
    write something, and time isn't an issue. I love writing on my iPad
    and iPhone. And editorial makes it easy to write, and easy to publish.
    It wouldn't be possible without it.

-   **[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)** is the podcasting app I always
    wanted. It have the simplicity of Instacast, the beauty of Castro and
    the power of Downcast. It is the only podcast app I have been happy
    wih.

-   **[Pedometer ++](http://pedometerplusplus.com/)** is my step counter.
    It is the kind of app that do one thing. Keep track and visualize how
    much I move. It's great.

-   **[Unread](http://supertop.co/unread/)**. There have been many great
    rss clients over the years. But all of them have been more or less
    like NetNewsWire or Reeder. Unread was the first one that felt new and
    different. It makes it simple to get through the feeds, in a way where
    I don't send everything to Instapaper. A great app.

-   **[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)** was the first iOS app I
    paid for. It does one thing way better than any other read it later
    app, and that is to read. There are many others, with a lot of fancy
    crap. I don't care about it. Instapaper is made for reading first. And
    the others doesn't.

-   **[Left to spend](https://appsto.re/no/nM2mx.i)** is my budget app of
    choice. Well it isn't strictly a budget app. I don't care that much
    about what I spent money on. I just want to keep track and limit how
    much I spend. Left to spend is made for that.

-   **[Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/)** is the first of two amazing
    games I have found for iOS this year. It's addictive and fun. I spend
    too much time playing it. It's a fun game you can play any time.
    Either before going to bed, or when you have a break.

-   **[Soulver](http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/)** is my go to
    calculator. I love writing, and Soulver combines writing and math.
    Spreadsheets and most calculator apps never clicked with me. But
    solver does.

-   **[Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com/)** is my last
    app, and the most impressive game I have ever played. I haven't met a
    single person that don't like it. The game play, look and feel is
    equal to none. The only thing I don't like is that it's never long
    enough.

Here is the list of all my current favorites. It was meant as a list of
4-5 apps, but ended up with a lot more. Enjoy.
