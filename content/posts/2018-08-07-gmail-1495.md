What a nightmare:
[G Suite](http://lawgimenez.me/2018/08/05/g-suite-horror-story/) and
[G Suite Happy
Ending](http://lawgimenez.me/2018/08/07/g-suite-happy-ending/).

This feature seems like a bad idea to me, and I think Google have a job
to do to make sure that people actually understand what they are doing.
