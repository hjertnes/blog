You have probably noticed that I have included keys on most of the
examples where I list stuff. This is a very important part of writing
performant react apps. They are not required, but recommended. The key
should always be the same for one entity, I usually use the primary key
of the entity I'm listing out. In other words: the key for one row
should always be the same, so no random keys.

There isn't much to the keys really. It is just a prop react use to keep
track of what to do when a list of something changes. Is it a new
entity? Did the entity change? Or was a entity removed. You don't have
to use them, but react will give you warnings in the console if you
don't, and you will notice the difference when you update large lists of
things.
