My setup at work is a fairly good HP laptop running Windows 10. With a
lot of junk installed on it, because, enterprice crap.

Some of my issues are that stuff, but that is not the main thing. I
really miss my Mac. The reason is simple, I prefer how a Mac works, and
the native UNIX system. It would not work at my current job, because of
how stuff are set up. But I know that I'd be much more faster in
general, if I typed in Emacs and iTerm2 on a Mac, than in Emacs and
Powershell on my Windows thing.

I have spent six months trying to like it, and I just hate it. I hate
how Window management is, how horrible everything looks. How much crap
can't be configured.

I love using my Mac, and I tolerate my Windows machine.
