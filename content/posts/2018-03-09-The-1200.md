When I spent weeks upon weeks to write about React I said that no one
should use the context api because it was likely to break in the future,
that time is coming. There is a new version of the
[context api](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/2) on it's way into
react. Look here for
[details](https://medium.com/dailyjs/reacts-Ô∏è-new-context-api-70c9fe01596b)
on how to use it.

The short version is that the new context API will be more like a
component, that you either use as a "Provider" or as a "Consumer".
Again, look in the blog post above for details.

It looks like it will be a million times easier to understand and use
compared to the old system.
