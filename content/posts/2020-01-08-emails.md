I have a long and very difficult relationship to e-mail. The short version is that I hate it. In some periods I work hard on unsubscribing from stuff and when the volume goes down to below a certain level I stop doing that. And then about a year later it have once gotten back to a level where I'm screaming.

The sad part is that it is not even close to the horror I deal with at work. And I have like 20 or 30 rules in Outlook to filter out anything I don't want to see.

Last week I started the process of unsubscribing once again. The way I do that is that once a week I unsubscribe from 10 newsletters. And I usually continue it until it becomes difficult to find stuff to unsubscribe from.
