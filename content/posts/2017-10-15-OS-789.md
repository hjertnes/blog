There are a few tasks I have to break down into small chunks. One of them are maintaining the “Audit” section of 1Password, another one is to manage Notifications on OS X.

So. The way you disable notifications on OS X, is more or less the same as iOS. You have to you through every singe app and disable everything. And it is a major pain in the ass.

My problem with it is two fold. First of all, why not let me mark all of them and do what ever I want to do with either all or any selection of apps. Second, why do I have to click a million different things to just disable notifications?

This is one of the areas where the iOS influence on OS X was wrong. Not the inclusion of it, but rather that the interface are lacking every ability to work efficient.
