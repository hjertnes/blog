[Evernote](http://evernote.com) just released version 6 of their OS X
app. And there are a lot of great things about it. For example, the
first user interface redesign that looks good.

But, I have some concerns about where Evernote as a company and product
is going. They have introduced two new features that I don't get: Chat
and Contexts. I can't understand how either of them belong in Evernote.
There are a lot of better chat solutions out there. And Context in it's
current form is more or less useless; and I also have som Privacy
concerns. Context wouldn't be that bad, if it was limited to your notes.

Anyways. I hope that the company moves back into just improving the
product.

The thing I really hope for in 2015 is a real competitor to Evernote.
They need it for two reasons: to get their act together and make the
service as good as possible, and to make sure they focus on features
that are relevant to the product.
