I have not done one of these in way too long.

Because I mostly use pencils in my pocket sized notebooks I ordered an
order of Field Notes; mainly because I was running out and I needed
something fast. I got a few packs of Pitch Black, which is really nice.
I think this is the first order of a limited edition Field Notes I have
ordered since Arts and Sciences. And I still use Leuchtturm1917
notebooks for long form writing and for managing tasks. One lined and
one dot grid.

Ink wise I have all of my pens inked up with Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki
Shikibu, which is the coolest colour I have bought in a really long
time.

I still carry my broad Vanishing Point, my medium Lamy 2000 and my board
flex Metal Falcon. And I carry a old school pencil case with 24 Golden
Bears(I never run out of sharp pencils).

And I carry spare Field Notes and the pens in my trusty Nock.co
Hightower. My current go to pencil sharpener is a Classroom Friendly.
