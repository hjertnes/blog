Relax everything is still up, just go
[here](http://hjertnes.me/archive). Like I wrote about in my
[last](https://hjertnes.squarespace.com/archive/2013/8/8/-writing-long-form)
blog post in the old blog -- I am going to dedicate all my blogging
related focus to writing fewer, better and longer pieces.

And the current blog have been through so many different formats and
blogging engines that I decided to start blank, and just move the old
one to another url. The old content will continue to exist in the
current form for a while, but not forever.

I don't subscribe to the idea that everything on the internet should
exist there forever in whatever form it was created in. I'm not 100%
sure what I am going to do with the old content, but I know that I will
sort it, and move some of it into its own "blogs" here on this site,
delete some of it and also do some rewriting and merging of articles.

I hope you enjoy the new format, and the new content.

And yes I know that I just broke every link to my site, and blog that
exist on the internet. Do you know what? I could not care less.
