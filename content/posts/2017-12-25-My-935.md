My current camera kit or setup is a Fujifilm X-Pro2 with three lenses, A
8mm f/3,6 Fisheye, and two Fujifilm F2 lenses: 35mm and 50mm. The only
thing I'm missing from it at the moment is a 23mm lens.

The fisheye is just for fun. And the 35mm is my trusty 50mm that I use
almost all the time; and I have the 50mm for when I want to take
portraits. The only thing I miss is something similar to a 35mm.

I could of course get a zoom lens that covers the area. But it would be
slower and heavier. This is my the best thing about the Fuji F2 lenses
(after the image quality) is how small and light they are. I have
considered ditching my 50mm and getting a 56mm a few times. But the
thing that always makes me stop, is how much heavier it is. It is
basically twice the weight of the 50mm I have. This means that I could
bring the 23, 35 and 50mm F2 + my camera body and my bag would weigh
less than if I had my camera body + the 56 + the 35.

I might consider it, if shot more portraits.
