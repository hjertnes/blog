One of the questions I ask myself the most often is: digital or analogue?

I tend to favour analogue, unless the digital option have some significant advantages.

For example, my current favourite app: Duolingo. It makes learning a language fun and approachable; something I have never seen in a text book. That is a significant advantage compared to the analogue.

Or my digital cameras have an advantage over it’s analogue parents, by letting me take a lot of pictures without going broke by developing or buying film.

E-books isn’t for me. I only buy them when a paper books isn’t available. My main problem with e-books as they are in most cases at the moment is that they don’t provide anything that a paper book doesn’t have. The only advantages I can see as a general rule is: lower delivery time and doesn’t require as much space. My problem with e-books is that everything disappears in the list. Either unread books or books that you enjoyed any would have read again if you saw it in the book shelf.

The thing about digital or anything that wants to replace what is needs to be better, and not just a little bit better, but a much better alternative to win.

Some people are 100% digital, while others are 100% analogue; but I expect most people to be somewhere in the middle.
