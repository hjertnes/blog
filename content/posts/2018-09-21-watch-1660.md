I just ordered a new Apple Watch. I'm getting more into that another
time. This is not something I think Apple would do, but I would prefer
some kind of bracelet style fitness band to a smart watch any day of the
week. In the same way I would prefer a smaller smart phone to the huge
ones we have today.

The reason I would prefer a bracelet, if it gave me the same fitness
features, is that then I could use my old school watch that I love. It
is aprently some fashion no-no to have one watch on each hand...
