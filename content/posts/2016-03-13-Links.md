I have gone back and forth, on if I should continue to link as I have been doing it, or move over to a single post with a list of links. There are pro and cons with both. There are two reasons I’m switching: First of all, it takes much less time to write a list than individual posts. And secondly, I can link to more stuff and be more free to only add commentary when I feel like it. The format also gives me an opportunity to comment on larger trends in any given week.

  <strong><a href="http://www.gourmetpens.com/2016/03/review-diplomat-excellence-evergreen-gt.html#.VuVaTMfsN_8">Gourmet Pens: Review: Diplomat Excellence A Evergreen GT Fountain</a>.</strong> Gold isn’t really my thing. But there is a few pens with gold colouring that peeks my interest from time to time. This is one of them. It have to be done in a classy way, without being to “bling” or too “grandad”.

  <strong><a href="http://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2016/03/review-leuchtturm-1917-sketchbook/">The Well-Appointed Desk: Review of Leuhtturm 1917 Sketchbook</a>.</strong> I’m a huge fan of Leuhtturm. They are very good at walking the line between minimal bleed through while maintaining short dry time. And they are also very good at giving people a good option to the core of Moleskine’s offering. This notebook looks like a very good option for anyone that either are sketching, want thicker paper or want a better option to their Moleskine Sketchbook.
