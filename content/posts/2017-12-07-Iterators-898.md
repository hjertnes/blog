An iterator is the underlying structure of arrays and everything else
you can loop over using for example for-of. You probably don't need to
implement one yourself, unless you are trying to make something that is
Lazy. A lazy iterator is when it continues to iterate as needed.

The basic idea is that you add a symbol (I'll add a example below) that
returns a object, with a next method, that returns an object with two
keys: value and done; done is a boolean telling the code that iterates
over the iterator if it is the last element or not.
