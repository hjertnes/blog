My main focus of late have been my [wiki](https://hjertnes.wiki) and [mastodon](https://dog.estate/@hjertnes) over the last year or so.

But as 2020 are concluding I've been thinking about what I'd like to change next year. One of them is that I'll start blogging more again.

I also made some traditional Norwegian christmas stuff for the first time yesterday:

Might also start participating the micro.blog community again. Haven't made up my mind on that.
