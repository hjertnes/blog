This was written as a draft back in August of 2018, but I never got
around to posting it.

The future of .NET is .NET Core, because of the corner Microsoft have
painted themselves in with regards to having to support all kinds of
different API's, workflows etc, the coming 4.8 version of framework will
probably be the last one. And all new stuff will happen in Core.

I also think that the future of Visual Studio will be based on Code.
Where the main thing is Visual Studio Code, with all the features from
Visual Studio missing as plugins in some shape or form.

The reason I think the future of Visual Studio is Code, is because the
current version of Visual Studio is slow, buggy and in general horrible,
while Code on the other hand is freaking great, and some plugins could
replace most of it.
