I'm fairly happy with the experience of moving over to Lightroom CC this
far. Uploads are as fast as I let them to be. And dealing with CC is far
less complicated than Classic. No options during import and the previews
are hidden under the hood.

There is also a downloader for those of us that want to make backups.
