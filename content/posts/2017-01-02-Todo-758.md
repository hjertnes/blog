I’m not a huge fan of productivity mastrubation, but I can’t help it. There are more “getting crap done” apps and services available out there than any sane person should every try out; even though I personally have tested out way too many of them (and made too many myself). You have everything from team based to personal based; to very simple to very complicated. I am of the conviction that you have a lot to earn by figuring out if and what could fit into a either paper or plain text task management system. What I learn’t the first time I did it was to move parts of my tasks into more aporopriate containers. For example: all “reminders” and recouring tasks are in due, everything related to habit forming are in Productive and everything with a hard due dates are in my calendar.

Everything looks like a nail when you have a hammer. My biggest problem with the more sofisticated task management system is that it is too easy to set reminders and due dates and all of the fancy crap. Something should be easy, if you want people to do it all the time, but the oposite if you don’t want them to do it all the time. Setting reminders on too many tasks are a problem because you start ignoring them if you get them all the time. And then they are as worthless as not having them at all.

My first introduction to plain text task management as a formal system was with an Mac an iOS app called TaskPaper, and later I also discovered Todo.txt. There are probly others as well. But these are the only ones I have used enough to feel confident talking about them in detail.

Both systems are great, and you don’t really need any tools to deal with either one. You will get the hang of either one very fast if you know how to write either html or markdown. But there is one philosophical difference between the two: todo.txt is more like a database record where all the data assosiated with one entry is on one line, while taskpaper is more like an outline or tree structure of projects, tasks and notes(and tags).

My personal favourite is Taskpaper, both because there are a lot more tools available and because I think it is easier to work with, but it is a little bit harder to write code that parses it. Todo.txt is on the other side not as blessed on the tool side, but it has a format that is very easy to get a grasp on, something that should be very interesting to beginning hackers and programmers. I also think that Todo.txt could be a interesting basis for a database standard for “GTD” apps. Todo.txt is also a little bit more like a proper system; you have the file with your tasks and you have the file with your archived tasks. This isn’t really a thing with taskpaper, you just have documents, and it is up to you to figure out how to use them.

Which one you pick is up to you, I would give both a shot, just to figure out which syntax and system that fits your way of thinking the best. I personally have gone back to taskpaper because the Mac app is fantastic and I think it is much easier to parse a outlined structure than a bunch of almost identical lines. Still I think Todo.txt could be used in some very interesting ways, especially if someone made a really good Mac app that used it as its database.
