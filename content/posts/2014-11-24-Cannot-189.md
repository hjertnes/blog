I spent a large portion of the weekend trying to figure out why I
couldn't access the App Store from my phone. The strange thing was that
the step listed at all the sites I visited didn't work. But I finally
managed to find out how to fix it last night.

I'm just writing it up here, to know where to look the next time around.
I'm going to include all the usual tips, plus the thing that solved it
for me.

1.  Restart your phone.

2.  Hard reset: press and hold your home button and power button until
    the device powers off.

3.  Reset Network settings: Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset network
    settings

4.  Force quit the App Store app; double click your home button, find the
    app store app, and drag it up and out to kill it.

5.  If on wifi: try Celluar; and the other way around.

6.  Reconnect to your wifi network; go in to Wifi settings and "forget"
    the network, before connecting again.

7.  Reboot your wifi router.

8.  View your AppleId; go to Settings -- iTunes & App Store -> Click on
    your Apple ID -> View Apple ID. This is the one that solved it for
    me. It asked me to enter my password, and suddenly I was able to use
    the App Store again.

9.  Restore your phone. This is the last resort. There are times when
    this is the only option.
