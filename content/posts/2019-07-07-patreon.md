Patreon is fucked. The moment you take in investors, and especially VC
investors. You are expected to give them a return on their investment.

This means that Patreon will have to get more people onboard, they will
have to make more money off everyone.

This is probably not great new. Either the creators have to eat the
increased fees or te supporters; the former means less money for the
creators and the latter means that a lot of people will drop off, and
less money for everyone.

Also: remember that patreon bought memberful last year.
