[From Mastering Emacs](https://masteringemacs.com):

> Tinkering with Emacs is every Emacs hacker's favorite pastime.

This is the best Emacs book I've read, I first read it when I was int he
hostpital earlier this year, and I've re-read it this weekend now that
I'm trying to use Emacs without Evil. It is amazing.
