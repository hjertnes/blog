The original idea behind this article was just to write a few words
about the new pen, ink and notebooks I got a few days ago. But then I
changed my mind after the first draft. I'm going to give some real
context, and some history.

I have been a pen and paper user for as long as I can remember. Cheap
notebooks was the thing when I was in school. But then I started
working. And the thing I used for years, at work was just a pile of A4
printer sheets. They were available, easy to scan and flexible. This
phase lasted for a long time.

My deep dive into notebooks started in 2012. I can't remember exactly
why. But I started writing more away from a computer, and I started to
not bring my Macbook to meetings. This was the point where I started to
use notebooks again. I didn't use anything fancy, I knew there was
different paper and that they looked nicer, but I didn't know what that
meant for me. Why would 1 spend ten times as much on the same thing.

The point where I got into better notebooks is kind of fuzzy. But I
think there was some kind of Moleskine sale going on, where I just
picked up a few of them, to see what the deal was. One regular sized and
one pocked sized.

Before we move on. I know that a lot of notebook geeks aren't a big fan
of Moleskine. I think they are great. The paper isn't the best, and they
are a little bit expensive. But the great thing about the Moleskine
brand is that I can find a decent notebook in more or less any book
store.

I noticed right away that these notebooks were great. And I started to
use them more and more. It didn't take a long time before a pocked sized
Moleskine replaced my iPhone as my tool for taking notes when I wasn't
in front of a desk.

Me and pens are simpler. I have never been a regular "Bic" user. I
didn't like them, they where uncomfortable to use, and didn't last very
long. So, I have always been the kind of person that used something a
little bit nicer. A lot of Gel pens, like the
[Pilot G2.](http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-G-2-Gel-Ink-Pens/ct/610).

Then I discovered a podcast called [The
Pen Addict](http://www.relay.fm/penaddict). It is a great podcast, and you should start at the
beginning, if you start listening to it.

This was the moment when I started to get aware of different pens,
different paper and got a genuine interest in the subject. The first
thing I bought after I started to listen to the podcast was a
[Retro
51](http://www.jetpens.com/Retro-51-Tornado-Classic-Lacquers-Roller-Ball-Pen-0.7-mm-Black-Body/pd/8242). This is still one of my favorite pens. It is not very expensive
around $20, it's the best regular pen I have ever used and the build
quality is fantastic.

I lost my first one, but I bought another one, and it is still a part of
my regular pen tool set.

I'm not the kind of person that cares about having a collection. I just
like to have good tools, that will last me a very long time. That's the
reason I use a Macbook Air, that's the reason I use an iPhone, that's
the reason I have a expensive pair of Bose headphones and that's the
reason I buy nice pens.

The second thing I got into as a direct result of the podcast was some
very cool notebooks called [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com).
This is actually a funny story. I just ordered a couple of packs of them
to test it. Because I was very critical. They lack two qualities, that I
still love about the hardcover pocked sized notebooks from Moleskine.
Durability and it is easier to write on them when you don't have a flat
surface available. The former is something I haven't focused too much
on. I love how worn down Field Notes looks. And it isn't often they fall
apart. The lack of a hardcover also makes it possible to have them in
your back pocket.

But the lack of hardcover notebooks is still something I miss. It's not
a huge issue. But I think it is a great feature.

The thing that sold my right out of the gate with Field Notes is the
paper quality and price. They are kind of cheap, and the paper is great.
You can use everything from a Bic to a fountain pen.

My notebooks setup is more or less the same as when I discovered Field
Notes. I always carry them in my backpocket for writing down tasks and
small notes. And I use the regular black Moleskine to take notes in
meeting and lectures. The newest addiction is the
[Leuchtturm 1917](http://www.gouletpens.com/LBL13/p/LBL13), I use them
for my paper journal.

Then I got into fountain pens. It was a concern for me. Dry time is
always a issue for me. I'm a left handed writer. I ordered two entry
level fountain pens, just to see what it was like. It was a
[Pilot
Metropolitan](http://www.gouletpens.com/PN-Metro-BlackZigZag/p/PN-Metro-BlackZigZag) and a [Lamy
Safari](http://www.gouletpens.com/LMY-L17/p/LMY-L17). Two great pens, except for the grip bullshit on the Safari.
And I fell in love with it.

I decided to get a nice fountain pen about a year ago. And it was a long
process. I looked at a lot of different pens. But there was one very
distinct pen that I went for. And that was the
[Lamy 2000](http://www.gouletpens.com/lmy-l01/p/LMY-L01).

The pen looks great. It doesn't look like a conventional fountain pen,
but it has a very distinct a minimalistic german design, that I love.
And I knew that a Lamy pen would be a very safe bet. I loved the nig on
the Lamy Safari.

Now, I just had to do three things. First I wanted to get some advice
from Brad Dowdy of The Pen Addict
[podcast](http://www.relay.fm/penaddict) and
[blog](http://penaddict.com). Just to make sure I didn't make a stupid
decision, to find a ink and get the money. And I just have to thank Brad
here. He has always been helpful and have always taken the time to
answer my stupid questions. Thanks
[@dowdyism][10](http://twitter.com/dowdyism)!

The ink question was hard. I needed to find a black ink, I don't like
blue inks. And it had to be a black ink with a fast dry time. I ended
on: [Noodler's Bernanke
Black](http://www.gouletpens.com/N19066/p/N19066), after advice from Brad.

I finally have all the tools I need. My two pens look good and will
probably outlast me. And I have all the notebooks I need. And they all
work great together.

The funny thing about having a really nice pen and a really good
notebook, is that I spend way more time journaling than I should. I just
want to spend more time writing with my fancy pen. When I probably
should write something for this site.

One final note. I have ordered from many sites over the years. Most of
my pen and papers purchases are through
[JetPens](http://www.jetpens.com). They are great. Great selection,
good prices and fair prices on shipping to Norway. But I went to
[GouletPens](http://www.gouletpens.com) to order my Lamy 2000. My
experience dealing with them, was more or less like JetPens, until I got
the package. Their packing was very impressive. I love it when they make
sure it's packed in a safe manner, while still making it very easy to
unpack it. I will without doubt buy more stuff from them.
