I started out using both of the pen loops in the Seed, but I have since
stopped doing that. I still carry two pens. But I keep on in the pocket
on the outside instead. The reasons is that if I use both of them I have
to use the inner most pen. Most of the time that is what I want to do,
but sometimes I am using some other pen and it is kind of clumsy to have
to take the inner most pen out to be able to write in my notebook.
