**Iain Broome:**

> This is how I carry my notebook. I take three small Field Notes and
> stretch different coloured bands around their spines and middle pages.
> I use one for general note taking, one for my novel scribbles, and one
> for blog post and podcast ideas. It means the notes don't get mixed up
> and my to do lists never meddle with my brilliant brain-splurts. It
> works really well. I like it.
