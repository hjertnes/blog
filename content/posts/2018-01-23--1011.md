I just got my invite to the Drafts 5 beta. Drafts have been one of my
all time favourite iOS apps, I'm pretty sure I have used more or less
every single point release of it. And I continue to enjoy it quite a
lot.

The idea behind it is very simple: just start writing and worry about
where it goes later. What makes it powerful is how you can define your
own actions. In the past it was limited to url actions. While powerful,
you were limited to sending the text to applications on your iOS device
that had implemented a url scheme.

A url scheme is just a way where apps can define their own "protocol",
you could think of <http://> as a url scheme claimed by Safari, 1Password
used to have a 1p:// scheme (or something like that) in the old days to
make it easier to open stuff in the 1Password in-app browser. This was
way before extensions in mobile Safari.

Version five brings this to the next level by adding integrated support
for talking to web services; this is done through JavaScript. This means
that you could post directly to Micro.blog or your WordPress site
instead of having to first send it to the WordPress app or Micro.blog
app and then publish it from there.

It looks great, and I can't wait. And it looks like more of the heavy
lifting have been taken care of, compared to if you wanted to do
something similar using Pythonista.
