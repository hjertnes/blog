Over the last few months I have been wondering how it is like to use
regular Emacs. So, when I changed jobs I decided to give regular emacs a
shot because I would not use any of my personal machines for work stuff.

Using regular Emacs is unlike anything else. It is very powerful and
verbose, and it takes a really long time to get into it. But it was not
that hard to get the basics into the fingers (quitting, opening files
and saving files). I'm still in the "how the fuck was that again?"
phase. But I like this a lot better than I liked evil. The reason is
that everything feels way faster without it. This will be a long
journey, and expect a lot of emacs posts in the future .
