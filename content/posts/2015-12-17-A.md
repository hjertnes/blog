  The Lamy 2000 is a truly remarkable pen. Its fifty-year-old design still looks modern and edgy, and I’m sure that it will look just as edgy in fifty more years. The pen’s features, from the ink window to the piston knob, only appear when needed and then vanish into the pen’s brushed body. The Lamy 2000’s gold nib, perfect weight, and brushed body combine to form the best writing experience that I’ve ever had. If you’ve stumbled upon this review because you’re on the fence about this pen, go ahead and buy it. I spent several months reading reviews and none of them seem to do the pen justice, now that I have it in my hand. Aside from the functionality of the Lamy 2000, its history is something special. While I love my TSWBI, Kaweco, and Pilots, this will be the pen that I pass down to my children. In a world of throwaway things, this is a pen that is truly built to last.

In case you are wondering, yes I love the Lamy 2000, and I love how many great reviews of it that have been published lately.
