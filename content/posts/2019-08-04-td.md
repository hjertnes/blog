I just re-watched all of it, perfectly timed to the third season ending.

-   The first season was amazing, and felt like something completly new. It was so amazing the first time I watched it, less so the second time, but still great.
-   The second season was not bad, but everyone hated it. There are a lot of problems with the writing of it, but I think people would have liked it a lot better if it wasn't called True Detective. And it didn't follow the same format etc.
-   The third season is a lot closer to the first one in terms of how the story works. And I liked it a lot better. It is probably as good as the first one, except for it isn't the first time it is being done. \* True Detective
