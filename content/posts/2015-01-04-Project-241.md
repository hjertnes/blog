Stephen Hackett are doing Project 365 this year.

> "Project 365" is the name often given to photo-a-day projects.
> Starting today, I'm embarking on my fourth:

I have been taking pictures of myself in DayOne, more or less every day
for over a year now. I will continue doing that, but I think I'll do
Project 365 next year; I might sneak in a mini-Project 365 this year;
not for the full year, but maybe a Project 30 or something.

I love projects like this. Project 365, NANOWRIMO, NAJOWRIMO. They are
forcing you to do something you with you did more. Taking pictures,
writing fiction or journaling.
