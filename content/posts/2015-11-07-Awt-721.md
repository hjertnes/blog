I had a similar experience in 2012, my phone died, and I told my boss
I'd rather have a iPhone than a Android. And my boss told me that he
didn't want that, because I was developing an Android app. I responeded
by telling them to stop paying for my contract, and by ordering a iPhone
4S, and most of all: by looking for a new job.
