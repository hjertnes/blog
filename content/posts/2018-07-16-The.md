The Golden Bear is a #2 pencil made by Palamino and sold exclusively
through Pencils.com. You can get it in blue and orange; I went with
orange.

It looks great, and is a fantastic pencil to write long form. It is a
little bit harder and more scratchy than the 602. But it keeps a point
better. I think the barrel is a little bit more uncomfortable than the
Blackwings. But it isn't a problem.

If I'm going to write long form, like I am doing now, I'd probably pick
up this over the 602, because I can get around 30-50% more pages per
sharpen. But I kind of prefer the Field Notes pencil to this one,
because its round barrel is more comfortable to write with.

One important note however is that the price of this one is around $5
per back, while the Blackwing is over $20. This is the pencil I would
buy if I were on a budget. A fantastic cheaper pencil.
