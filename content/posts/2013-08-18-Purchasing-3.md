I finally did it; I ordered a new Macbook Air on thursday, and it
arrived the day after.


## Specs. {#specs.}

I always chose to put in as much memory and CPU power as possible when I
get a new computer; not because I need it now, but to hopefully get a
computer that is usable everything from a few months to a few years
longer.


## Macbook Air vs Macbook Pro with a retina screen. {#macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-with-a-retina-screen.}

I have been going back and forth on this issue many times during the
last few months, and I decided to go for a new Air. First of all, I
might have ordered a retina model if the new retina models have been out
by now.

You might wonder why I did not wait. I didn't wait because my old Air
was very close to dying on me. And I could not afford to wait any
longer.


## What's new? {#whats-new}

This computer is more or less the same as the one I had. It's faster,
longer battery life and much more memory.

The 4GB memory limit on my 2011 Macbook Air was without doubt the
biggest issue I had with it.

Other than that? I can't see much of a change.


## MagSafe-2 {#magsafe-2}

The new power adapter standard from Apple is the one and only thing that
I do not like at all about this computer. I understand why they did it,
but I still don't like it.

I own many of the old Magsafe-1 chargers, five to be exact. -- My office
-- One in each of my two bags -- At home -- My parents house

Because of the amazing 12 hours of battery that this model have to
offer, I might not need five adapters. I'm almost never 12 hours at my
office, and when I am I could just bring out the adapter from one of my
bags.


## It's a great evolution. {#its-a-great-evolution.}

Very few Apple products is a revolution, but this new Macbook Air model
is a great evolution, of a great products line. And I would like always
recommend most people a Macbook Air.
