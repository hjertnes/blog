I've seen the Deadwood ending a few times since it came out, and I think it is one of my favourite endings ever. The whole thing just wraps more or less everything up unlike anything I have seen before.

This is something I would love to see more of in the future, creators taking time to just wrap it all up. Either in a movie after the show or in a short mini season.
