The Sweet Setup picked Overcast as the best iOS podcast app, and I
agree.

This is why I think Overcast is the best:

-   The sync is fast and reliable. Podwrangler is the only other app that
    have delivered something that I could call a reliable sync between
    multiple devices.

-   The interface is good looking, easy to understand, and it is the only
    app that have been able to make something well designed and powerful.
    Instacast or Downcast is powerful, but looks terrible; Castro is good
    looking, but too simple.

-   I trust that Marco will continue to make the app better, and up to
    date with what ever Apple annonces on WWDC, this year, next year and
    so on.
