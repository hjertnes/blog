> I have a very mobile lifestyle, in the literal sense of the word. My
> post-treatment physical therapy requires me to move often and avoid
> sitting for several hours a day whenever possible. And every day, I
> have to leave my house at least twice to drive around Rome for
> errands, buy fresh groceries, or just pick up my girlfriend at class.
> I can't afford to sit at a desk for 8 hours and, truth be told, I like
> the freedom of not being constrained to a desk and use a desktop
> computer. One of the best takeaways from my journey so far is, without
> a doubt, a newfound appreciation for movement and the feeling of being
> free. This, I believe, has deeply changed how I work and slice up work
> times during the day.

> I need and want to be able to work on an iPad. I could use most of my
> iPad apps on the iPhone, but, even with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
> Plus, I wouldn't have the extra room for content and overall enjoyment
> granted by a 10-inch display. I've bought five iPads since 20104, and
> the iPad Air 2 provides the absolute best combination of screen size,
> comfort, and performance I've seen to date.
