Great post, with some good looking lenses for MFT cameras. I don't use
them, because I'm sticking with my big Canon DSLR.

I do so because:

-   Erognomics on big DSLRS are better, and I have noticed the difference
    when I spent whole days shooting.

-   I prefer to have a real optical viewfinder, because they are way
    faster than what an electionic one can be.

Picking lenses for your camera is always difficult. My advice is to buy
few and good lenses, always go for as low F-stop as possible, because
they are faster.

-   Get a good zoom lens, they are useful when you don't want to change
    them a lot.

-   Get something similar to similar to a 50mm on a full-frame, they are
    in general the best for shooting, and you can usually get a good one
    for not that much money.

-   Get a wide one, but not so wide that it becomes a fish-eye. They are
    very good for landscape.

Other cool lenses are:

-   FIsh eye lenses. They are not "good" for anything, they are just cool

-   Macro lenses. They are awesome to take pictures for tiny things like
    flowers and bugs.

I always say the following. Invest in a camera system you will stick
with. So that you can bring your lenses and other camera gear from one
camera body to the next one.
