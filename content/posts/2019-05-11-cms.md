I've been working a little bit on changing how I manage my sites recently. The Inksmudge is still on Hexo but I'll move it over to Gatsby soon. And I have created a [wiki](https://wiki.hjertnes.blog) using the same setup.

I have configured Gatsby to work with a folder structure of front matter markdown files like Hexo, Hugo or Jekyll does. And it just generates a folder of HTML. I host and build it with [Netlify](https://netlify.com). But I write it all using org-mode, through ox-hugo. I just have a few org files that I geneerate markdown files from.

I'm really happy with this setup because it makes it just a little bit easier because I don't have to create a lot of files etc. Probably not something most people want. But it works great for me. One thing to note though, I do keep blog posts in multiple files for this site, because a single org file doesn't scale beyond a few hundred. Than it all becomes kind of slow, and it takes a long time to generate
