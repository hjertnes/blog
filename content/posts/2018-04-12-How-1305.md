I draft more or less every single blog post on paper. Usually using a
pencil or a fountain pen. Then I write it into MarsEdit and publish
them. Or usually schedule them for publishing later.

I'm not a careful editor. But I often do a full re-write when I'm not
happy with it. The process of first writing it on paper and then
re-writing them is a exercise I enjoy, because then I can use the paper
draft to figure out what I want to say, before I re-write it into
something much shorter and more concise.
