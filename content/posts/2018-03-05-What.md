What I carry these days are more or less the same as always, with some
minor changes.

I always carry three pens, and I rotate them from a collection of five
that I have in active use: Lamy 2000(M), Pilot Vanishing Point(B), Pilot
Metal Falcon (Broad Flex), TWSBI Clear Eco(B), TWSBI Black Eco(Sub).

All of them are inked up with the same ink, as always. I currently use
the Diamine Sargasso Blue, which I reviewed a while back.

As always, I use my Nock.co Hightower to carry my pens and pocket sized
stuff.

Some of this stuff might change when Nock.co releases their A5 and
Travelers Notebook Covers.
