[React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) is
a pair of extensions for Chrome and Firefox that makes it much easier to

have it installed, the result of you should install it.

It also makes it easy to see if something are using React, and if the
build settings are following the recommended settings for production.
