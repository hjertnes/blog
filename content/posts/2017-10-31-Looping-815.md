There are two ways (that I'm aware of) to loop over an object in plain
Javascript; either use the for in syntax, example number one below, or
by using Object.keys, see example number two.

I personally prefer the fist method, because it involves less typing, but the second example might be easier to understand, if the developers on your team aren&#8217;t familiar with the difference between for in and for of.
