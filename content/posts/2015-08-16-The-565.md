I have been saying this for years, don't buy a mirrorless camera or a
dSLR unless you intent to get into taking pictures. Which means,
learning how to use your camera and having it as your hobby. Most people
will get better pictures from a high-end point and shoot than they will
ever get from a SLR or MFT camera.
