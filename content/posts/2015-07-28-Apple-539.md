Oh man! There are some problems with Apple Music. And I get why some
people want to ditch it. I personally archived my old iTunes library,
and removed almost everything from it, a long time ago. In other words:
I have a pre-Apple Music, and a pre-Spotify copy of my iTunes library .

The problems with iTunes and everything related to it is that it is just
a mess. Everything from the user interface to old stuff they can't
remove.

I feel bad for Jim, and I get why he left. But I'm willing to give Apple
the full three months before I make up my mind.
