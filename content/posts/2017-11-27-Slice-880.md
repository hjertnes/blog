Slice is a method on the Array Prototype that you can use to extract a
section of a array. Let's say you want to remove the first two elements
from a array. Then you could do something like this:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/bbae1bbb289cbdc8c48808aa070e2817.js>"></script>

</div>

You could of course do the same with a combination of filters and map
without using slice:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/1915e03f23a117aaafaa1d3d352d2c20.js>"></script>

</div>

There aren't much to the slice method, but the key thing is that it
doesn't mutate the array you run it on, but rather it returns a new
copy. It takes two arguments: begin and end. If you don't give it a end
it treats the end as to the end of the array. And you can give it a
negative number of remove things at the end. For example, like below to
remove the last three elements at the end; without doing some weird
.length hacks or double reversing.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/27328f23a8ad6e4ba6bb5d82209b4137.js>"></script>

</div>

Slice is a very versatile and useful method, when you need to modify a
list based on position instead of content. And it much more elegant than
some of the other solutions I have seen (and written) to get the same
thing. Everything from something like my map + filter hack above to some
more advanced uses for the old school for loop.
