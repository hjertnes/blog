My top 3 favourite pencils, in order:

1.  The Blackwing 602
2.  The Field Notes Pencil
3.  The Golden Bear.

The 602 is the better pencil because of how smooth it is to write with,
and how comfortable it is to hold, while the Field Notes pencil is even
more comfortable to hold but not as smooth to write with. And the Golden
Bear is a great pencil, but a much more crude and basic pencil. At the
end of the day however, I prefer the Golden Bear because it is much less
expensive and I can buy it in bulk. For the price of One and half box of
602's I can get 144 Golden Bears.
