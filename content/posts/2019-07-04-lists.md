I'm a list person. I write them for everything, and I mean everything.

If I'm going to do anything I start by writing it out as a list, and
this includes watching movies, tv-shows, reading books, my instapaper
queue and so on.

The reason I do this is that I'm a procrastinator, and having a list of
items I do not have to think about makes everything easier for me. Also
it feels great to cross out items. And it feels great to see some kind
of progress.

It is a total productivity hack, but some hacks are actually good.
