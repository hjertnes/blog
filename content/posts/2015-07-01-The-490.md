That's a lot of pens, I own six pens, but I never carry more than 3 or

1.  And only 4 of the pens I own is in use.

2.  Lamy 2000. This is my go to pen, I always use it, if the paper I am
    writing on is good enough. Everything from Field Notes to lecture
    notes, blog post drafts and journaling.

3.  Retro 51. This or the G2 below is the pen I use when I can't use a
    fountain pen. Both of them are very good.

4.  Pilot G2 0.7.

5.  Pilot Super Grip Medium Ball Point. This is the most acceptable pen I
    have found for something very specific. I need a ball point pen for
    when I'm working (fundraising) or when I take exams. Because I need
    something where I am forced to write hard enough for carbon paper to
    do its job. It isn't fantastic, but it is better than the other ball
    points I have tried. And it lasts forever.
