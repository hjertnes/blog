Facebook used to have just one mobile app, one on iOS and a similar one
on Android. Then they bought a company, and suddenly they had two, one
regular app, and a Messenger app. Some people love it, while others hate
it.

I think Facebook's Messenger platform is one of the best messenging
platforms out there, especially now that we have a web-version of it,
for laptops and desktops.

The number one complaint about Facebook app is that they removed the
messenging functionallity from their app. I think it was a great move,
just because the messaging functionallity in their regular app was so
terrible. It was never good.

I'm a weird Facebook user, I use the Messanger app a lot, but I don't
use Facebook itself for much.

Facebook is a platform, and Messanger is also a platform; and Facebook
need to innovate in both to keep growing. It seems like a new version of
what we called IM 17 years ago, and IRC before that is the "hot" thing
at the moment.

We don't really do much new, it's just a new version of something old.
Or like a lot of people summarize the history of philosophy: it's just a
bunch of footnotes to Plato.
