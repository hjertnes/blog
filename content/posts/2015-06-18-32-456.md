I love Field Notes. I think they are the best pocked sized notebooks. I
use them for my todo lists, and quick notes. They look good new, used
and destoryed. And most important -- you can use everything from a
roller ball to a fancy fountain pen. And they are way better than the
smiliar sized Moleskine notebooks; both in terms of durability, design
and paper quality.

I have 32 used notebooks after using them for over two years. Take a
look.

P.S: The Stephen King book in picture 6 is It.
