I don't use erasers, I just strike I line through the word or sentence
or paragraph and continue. It is faster and easier. That means that I do
not need that silly thing on the top of my American pencils.

You may argue that they are there for design reasons and not utility
because all of them suck. But that is a discussion for another day. So
what I do to them is that I pull them off, throw them in the garbage and
sharpen both sides.

This is what we used to do in school, because here in Norway, most of
our pencils was German. And none of them had erasers on the top. Instead
we got regular erasers that actually worked. I think we got one eraser
and two pencils per semester from the school and had to supply the rest
ourselves.

Anyways. I love sharpening both sides, because I get twice the amount of
writing out of each pencil before I have to re-sharpen it.
