You can write iOS apps using various different programming languages.
You have Swift and Objective-C; and you various ways you can do it with
Javascript. There are ways where you can use C#, and of course game
engines are used to make the same game for many different platforms.

But I'd love to see Apple extend this. One of the awesome things about
.NET and Java(the real kind, not the Android thing) is that the virtual
machine or the run time is designed in a way where you can use Java
libraries in other programming languages running there, without having
to implement specific packages allowing it.

I want to write native iOS and Mac apps using Clojure. Someone else
might want to do so using Ruby or even PHP. I have no idea if this is
possible with the current iOS or Android runtime, but I'd love it if we
moved against a world where all the app development stuff wasn't so tied
two a couple of programming languages on each platform.
