This is the situation, [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) is the
latest in security issues. It's a bug in OpenSSL, the library most
security related technologies use these days. Everything from sites
running over SSL, to VPN and regular file encryption.

I'm not too scared, I'm not.

Here is the reason.

_I use 1Password._

I store most of the sites I have visited since 2011, in 1Password. And I
can just create a smart folder, and start changing every single password
in there when I need to.

It's not that I'm not scared that people will steal my passwords and
break in. The thing is that I know that my passwords are unique, and
that it's not a huge hassle to change them.

So, if you haven't purchased
[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) yet -- do it -- today.
