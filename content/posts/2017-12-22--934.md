I thought I would share this little tip right before the holidays. When
I assume those of you that believe in New Years Resolutions are planning
them.

When ever I know that I should do something about something that
requires a lot of doing the same thing many times over. Like changing a
lot of passwords or unsubscribing from newsletters etc, I often to this
thing where I just add a repeating task for it. As a much more
approachable and less procrastination prone way to do something about
it.
