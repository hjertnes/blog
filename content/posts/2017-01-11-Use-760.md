There are still a lot of bad apps out there, most of them lack good design, and many of them also lack the details that makes it usable. The former requires more resources, but the latter should not be that difficult.

I listen to a lot of audio, either in form of music, audiobooks or podcasts on my iPhone. This is an area where I think you really need to be into “it” in order to make a good app.

Let me use an example. I bought some audiobooks from a Norwegian site called e-bok a few days ago. I usually get them from Audible, because their app is superior to anything else I have tried. It is easy to download content, they never mess up where to continue when I pause and so on. But I had to get this somewhere else because it was a Norwegian book series.

I first tried their app, and it was so bad that I had to give up, download the books on my Mac, transfer them via iTunes to play them in iBooks.

My guess is that the people in charge of delivering this app (developers and project managers and so on) don’t listen to audiobooks. There are three big problems with the app. The first is that they don’t have any settings for playback speed, some people prefer 1x, but many prefer either faster or slower speed. I don’t think I have seen any audiobook or podcast app – ever – that does not have this setting. The second problem is that it very often restarted at the beginning of the chapter after I had paused it. This ended up being very annoying, because sometimes you listen for hour after hour without stop, and other times you have to pause it very often. And the last big problem with it was the playback controls. Most music apps have the standard playback controls: Back, Play / Pause, Forward; where back and forward skips in that direction. This works great for music because you usually restarts or moves to the next song. But this does not work when you deal with spoken audio content like audiobooks and podcasts. Then you very rarely skip, instead you might move forward og backward in x second increments. For example after you paused it, and you need to go back a minute or so to understand where you are in the story.

I guess that most of these issues are something that they could have fixed without too much work. But the key problem from my perspective is that you need to have people on your project that have the domain knowledge. And that is in this case someone who enjoys to listen to audiobooks. You can probably detect most of the critical problems with listening a little bit here and there, but the only way to find the more subtle problems that would drive a avid user insane would be to get someone to listen to entire audiobooks using the app.

When the whole premise behind your business is to sell e-books and audiobooks, shouldn’t you strive to make the best app possible for that purpose in order to make sure that your get returning customers?
