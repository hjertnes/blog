Check out the video. Audio and screens, there is a point where you just
can't see the difference. MP3 files back in the 90's was bad. But what
we get with modern MP3, AAC or just any streaming service is pretty
good. It's not perfect.

Pono was a bad idea from the start. A lot of people hate digital music
because of what they think it is; this is the result. A player that
delivers audio with a level of quality that most, if any human can
distinguish from a high quality iTunes audio file.
