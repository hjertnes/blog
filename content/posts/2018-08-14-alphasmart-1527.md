The AlphaSmart Neo2 is a electronic typewriter. I finally got around to
ordering one a couple of months ago. And it is awesome.

It is a computer made to do one thing: let you type text into it. The
keyboard is a great, it is light and you use regular AA batteries.

The way it works is that it has eight "files" that you can store text
in. In total it can store somewhere between 100 and 150 pages of text.
And each file has a maximum of 24.5 pages of text. You start it, pick a
file and start typing. And you just turn it off when you're done.

Then, when you want to transfer it to your computer, you just open the
app and file you want it in, connect it by USB, select the file on your
AlphaSmart and click send. This will transfer character by character
like a USB keyboard would. It is slow, but it means that you do not need
a driver. It would probably be faster, haven't it been for the very slow
CPU in the AlphaSmart.

Remember to change the keyboard layout on your computer to US English
before clicking send.

This is the perfect computer for writing, if you want something small,
light without any distractions. I personally love using it for
transcribing blog post drafts from my notebooks to it.
