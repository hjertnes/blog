This is about the tools, all the tools. And not about how I do it

So. I use the LT1917 A5 Bullet Journal notebooks. They are great, mostly
the same as their regular A5 notebooks, except it says Bullet Journal,
have three markers instead of two and it has some instructions for
Bullet Journaling. They are great.

Then I use my two faourite fountain pens in it. My Pilot Vanishing Point
and my Lamy 2000. I only use Pilot Iro inks, currently a purple one.

And I have a Nock.co Seed cover I keep it all in. In the beginning I
tried to get away with some cheaper solutions than the seed. But I ended
up getting it because it is so much more convenient to just have one
thing to bring somewhere, than many.
