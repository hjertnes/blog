Higher order functions (or components, if you're using React) is a
functions that does at least one out of two thigns. It takes a function
as a argument; not its value, but the function itself. Or it returns a
function itself; again, not the value from it but the function itself.
This might be considered a very exotic topic in many languages, but
should be common practice for every JavaScript developer. You are doing
this every time you use a callback, a map/filter/reduce or a promise.

Higher Order Functions, in both forms is a very useful teqnique to avoid a lot of almost identical code. And even more useful when you start to code in React by doing the same thing just by taking components as arguments instead of functions or returning components instead of functions.
