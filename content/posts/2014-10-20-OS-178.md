Yosemite is here. And a lot of people love the idea of getting phone
calls and sms available on their iPhone's, Mac's and iPad's; while I
cringe.

If there is one thing that drive me nuts about FaceTime, it have to be
the fact that all my Apple devices makes noise every time I get a
FaceTime call. And I expect it will get a lot worse, with the posibility
of sms and celluar call forwarding.

Some people believe that opting in is the best way, while others think
opting out is better. I don't give a fuck either way. But the thing that
drive me nuts is stuff that are stealing my attention.

I would love to see a screen every time I upgrade OS X, with a list of
everything, and let me disable everything I don't need or want.

Let's get back to phone calls and FaceTime. My problem with call
forwarding and FaceTime is not that it is possible, my main issue with
it is that I only have the option between disabling it or enabling it.
There is now way for me to just say, only accept calls on my mac, when
the FaceTime app is open.

I'm probably a edge case, and yes I have disabled all of it, on
everything except my phone.
