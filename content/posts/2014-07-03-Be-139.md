I have been reading Randy Murray's
[blog](http://whowritesforyou.com/2014/07/03/you-suck-at-writing-and-thats-ok/?utm%5Fsource=rss&utm%5Fmedium=rss&utm%5Fcampaign=you-suck-at-writing-and-thats-ok)
for a long time now. And I love it.

Check out the link, it's about sucking.

I started out being a terrible writer. I never cared about writing. And
then I started a blog. I have written many hundred thousands of words,
if not millions. And I still think I suck. But I show up almost every
single day. And I do the best I can.

My goal is always be as good as I can be.

I don't think you can ever reach the level of your heroes.

There was this interview with BB King that I saw on YouTube a few years
ago. I can't find it right now. But it was great. He talked about how he
thinks that he wasn't as great as the people that was his heroes growing
up. And BB is the fucking kind of the blues.

Keep writing or whatever you are doing. That's the only way to get
better at it.
