A great post, about a great pen. I didn't go for it when I got my really
nice fountain pen. I went for the Lamy 2000. There are many reasons for
it

-   I'm a lefty, and the clip really annoyed me when I tried a Vanishing
    Point.

-   I prefer Lamy pens.

-   I think the Lamy 2000 looks cooler

-   I prefer piston fillers.

There are many different questions you need to ask youself before
getting a expensive pen, like this one, or a Lamy 2000. And you need to
try this one in person before buying it, because of the clip placement.

It's a good pen, a lot of people love it, I don't.
