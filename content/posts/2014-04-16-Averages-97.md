There are two things that always happens when someone discuss when Apple
will update "device X". They go to MacRumours, to check how many days
since the last update, and the average number between each update.

And then I think -- is it relevant?

Let me explain. I think the patterns in how often they update something
is way more important than the last time, and the average.

It doesn't matter anyway. Apple will realease something new -- when they
are ready.
