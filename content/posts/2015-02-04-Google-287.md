**The Verge:**

> Some of the web's biggest companies have been paying to get around
> Adblock Plus, according to a new report from Financial Times.
> Microsoft's Bing search ads and Taboola's "recommended links" box are
> among the ads that are currently slipping through Adblock Plus's

> deal between the makers of Adblock and the owners of the ads.
> According to FT sources, the companies have paid Eyeo (the maker of
> Adblock Plus) to be added to an official whitelist, which allows them
> to bypass the plug-in. Google has a similar deal, as has been
> previously reported.
