Crystal is a upcoming "content blocker" for iOS. The short version of
the story is that Apple will allow developers to develop Safari
extentions to block content, everything from ads to trackers etc on iOS

I don't mind non-intrusive ads. My problem is when I have to download
tens upon tens of megabytes of javascript libararies and resources for
tracking purposes on (almost) every single site I go to.
