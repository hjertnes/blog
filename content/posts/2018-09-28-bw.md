I decided to get a box of Blackwings with the extra firm core. Because I
managed to find them for sale on the Norwegian store I buy most of my
pen stuff.

It is the Volume 54. It is pink, which is not really my thing, but still
not that bad. This core is much better than anything else I have used
from Blackwing. It feels really smooth like every Blackwing, but still
firm enough to not be annoying.

This is the first Blackwing where I don't think "damn I have to sharpen
this a lot". And I think I could have used this as my only pencil
without issue, if it was a part of their regular line of pencils. But it
is very expensive...

There are three things I always notice when I use Blackwings:

1.  Design, they always look great, even though it isn't always my thing,
    they always feature the best pencil design ever.

2.  Their cores are always very smooth. It being smooth seems to be the
    number one priority, and that firmness will never come before that.

3.  They are very comfortable to hold. It is either something with the
    pain job or how they form the wood case.
