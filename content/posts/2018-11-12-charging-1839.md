I have never been a huge fan of what some call "wireless charging" and
other call inductive charging, the key principle is that instead of
plugging it in you place it on top of some kind of surface that can
charge it. Kind of similar to how the Apple Watch charger works. What I
don't like about it is that it charges much slower and that it is too
easy for someone (like my dog) to knock it off a little, resulting in it
not charging.

While I still think my main argument still is true, and valid, I think
inductive charging has its place. For example at desk, where I ideally
would like to charge my iPhone and AirPod case while sitting there, but
I would never bother to plug and unplug them many times a day. This is a
place where I would think that inductive charging really shines. Except
for the fact that the AirPod case don't support Qci.

A while ago I bought a IKEA desk lamp with support for inductive
charging. And I love it.

I don't think it is a good idea to replace regular charging with
inductive is the way to go, because there are times when you just want
to charge as fast as possible. But I do think that having this really
convenient slow charge is awesome, when you don't care if it takes 2 or
3 hours to charge your device.
