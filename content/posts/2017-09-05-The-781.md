The way we have built applications (I’m using the term applications here for everything from web sites, to backends, apps etc) that had more complex requirements than some file based storage is databases, and most of them used to be based on the simple idea of tables and relations between them. You can look at it as a spreadsheet that can reference between sheets and have strong requirements to what kind of data is allowed, both per row and per table. Most databases use some variant of the SQL language.

Today many use a different data model than SQL databases like for example the document based model of MongoDB. There are many good reasons to go for either. The good thing about something like mongoldb is that you don’t need to think that much about how to design the database to make it scale well enough. And it is much easier to get it to work in a distributed model.

While to good thing about SQL databases is that many of us know them really well. We know how to design them to be fast, flexible and scale really well. Not to mention how to tune the database servers behind them. And we also have really good systems for abstracting away some of the more complex parts of it; like Django’s ORM or .NET’s Entity Framework.

There is an art to designing good databases, that perform well and solve the problems you want to solve. You can ask for just the data you want, and do a lot of the heavy lifting on the database server instead of on your webserver or in your application. By using stored procedures (small programs that live in the database) or using views to simplify complex queries(a view is a way to make a “table” out of a complex query)

I love SQL and have spent a lot of time over the last fifteen years or so to learn it really well. And I don’t think SQL will go anywhere. But using SQL is in many ways a tool where it isn’t any better than the developer behind it is. Kind of like C. It is a absolute nightmare if the developer don’t know what they are doing, and it is amazing if the developer is.

What I hope is that those who don’t care move over to SQL, and those who do take their time and learn how to master this amazing piece of technology.
