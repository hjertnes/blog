I have been trying to get into meditation for a very long time. I think
some of my first attempts where back in 2009. It have been difficult to
identify what is important and not. And I gave up after reading
countless books. The "breathing" app on my Apple Watch got me back into
it, and I used the Oak app for a while. Before I started to use
Headspace a few days ago. It is awesome. And I would encourage anyone
that want to get into it to check it out.
