I'm a [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) user. And I have been using it
for a very long time. But, sometimes I download and test some other
journaling apps, just to see what's out there.

Most of the major ones are pretty nice. But there is three things that
Day One get, that all the other ones don't get.

_Simplicity_. Some of them have very complex interfaces. That's such a
turn off. They make the difficult process of journaling harder than it
have to be.

_Dated_. Some of the alternatives out there look dated. The thing I love
about Day One is that updates for new major releases of OS X and iOS are
usually there on Day One, or a few days later. And that is important. I
want to use a product I know is supported well for journaling. It might
be the most important app on my phone and laptop.

_Hard_. The last, and maybe the most important thing a lot of the
alternatives don't get right is how many clicks it is to start a new
entry. Day One have two large buttons on the top of their iPhone app.
One for writing, and one for adding either a new or existing image. It's
great. I know it's one click to start.
