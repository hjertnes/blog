The notebooks I have been carrying as of late -- I don't remember
exactly when I re-added the pocket sized notebook to what I carry -- but
it has remained the same since then.

I carry one Nock.co pocket sized notebook, one Leuchtturm1917 Bullet
Journal, one Leuchtturm1917 Lined A5 and a regular sized Traveler's
Notebook filled with lined refills.

The reason I carry two different lined notebooks is that one of them
contains drafts for various long form stuff I am writing, while the
other is just journal entries.

I have decided to do something about this. What I'm going to do short
term is to use up the last lined refill for my Travelers Notebook,
before I move over to just using the Leuchtturm1917 and then I'm going
to move back to using the Travelers Notebook.

As always, I might go back, if that makes sense. But at the moment it
feels light to slim things down a little bit. And only carry one
notebook for each thing, instead of two for long form writing. x
