**Alfred:**

I have been waiting for Alfred Remote app for a while now. The concept
is interesting, and I think it makes my mac, my iPhone and Alfred itself
more useful.

I have never been a fan of most remote control apps. Managing your mac
from iOS have never been good. This is the first idea that I like.
