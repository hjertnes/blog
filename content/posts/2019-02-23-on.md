I'm a huge fan of Rober Carro's books, it all started with his amazing
book about Robert Moses, and then continued as I read an listened
through all of his books about LBJ. They are amazing, and my all time
favourite biographies because of how well you get to know both the good
and bad sides to them.

They are great, but long, and kind of intimidating. On power on the
other hand is a short audiobook on Audible; it is one of their original
production thingies. It is a fantastic place to start. It gives you a
entry point to his writing, and if what you hear there is interesting
you can just jump into either the Power Broker or the LBJ books.
