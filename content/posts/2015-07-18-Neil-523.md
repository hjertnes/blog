> I love you Neil, but you're wrong on this one.

I could not agree more, Neil Young is a fantastic musician, but he is
just wrong here. The great thing about the digital age is that you have
streaming for convenience, you have the iTunes Music Store for buying
Music, and you have PonoMusic if you want true lossless.
