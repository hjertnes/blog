I don't use a case on my iPhone, and I have never used one for more than
a few weeks. I have one for my iPad, but thats more of a practical
reason, than keeping it from getting scratched up.

I have my pens in the same jeans pocket as my keys are. My Field Notes
live in my back pocket. And my large notebooks are just lose in my
backpack.

Everything I own have dints and or scratches. My phone, iPad, Macbook
Air, SLR, Pens, and you can see that I have used all of it.

You should use your stuff, without thinking about preserving them in
"perfect" condition, because you can't.

Which bring me to my point here. You have two kinds of well designed
products. The stuff that looks the best straight out of the box. And the
stuff like Field Notes or a Fender Guitar the more you use and wear it
down the cooler it looks

Use it! Make it yours!
