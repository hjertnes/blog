[Overcast](http://overcast.fm) is the new and anticipated app by Marco
Arment. I have been looking forward to this release since I thought he
was doing a podcast app. And then he announced it at XOXO last year.

This is a all around great podcast app. It doesn't have everything, but
it does have everything I need, and some features I didn't know I
wanted. The app have some cool tricks, like smart EQ'ing; great for
listening to podcast while walking outside. And gap compressing; great
for podcast with a lot of gaps.

Marco is a classy guy. He knew that this app wasn't for everyone. So, he
added a list of podcast apps that he things is great in the app. This is
amazing, and I hope that a lot of developers start copying this.

It's a free app, with a $4.99 iAP. Go and check it out.

I would have payed up to $20 for it!
