When I decided that the Golden Bear is my pencil, at least for now it
was because they are really cheap. And the difference between them and
more expensive pencils are simply put not worth it. They might be
better, but not better enough.

So, with the next order from Pencils.com I picked up a 144 pack. It
seems like a random number, but it is just 12 x 12. It makes the pencils
a little bit cheaper, but not a huge difference.

And what I love about this pack is that there are no branding or
marketing on the package. Just a huge box of pencils.

I might go for the blue ones the next time?
