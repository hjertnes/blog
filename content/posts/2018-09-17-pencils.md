The moment I got home after recieving the Clasroom Friendly Sharpener
through eBay and tested it out on a few pencils I started to consider
ordering another one. Because it is the only sharpener I want to use.

I did not do that. But instead I found a pen case or pouch at home and
sharpened 24 pencils on both ends and started to carry that. The pouch I
found at home have since been replaced by one from Nock. But the same
principle stands.

Instead of doing what I did in the beginning, where I used up on pencil
before moving on to the next, I now carry a lot of sharp pencils. And I
use one after another and then re-sharpen them when I get home. Not
usually every single day, but 2-3 times a week. But I usually stick to
one pencil and re-sharpen it as often as I need when I am at home.

I still carry the KUM Masterpiece though, just in case, but I have never
needed it.
