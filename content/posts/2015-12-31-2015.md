I officially launched this site a month and a half ago. The progress up until now have gone beyond any hope or expectation.

Brad Dowdy of The Pen Addict mentioned the site on <a href="<https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/186>">#186</a> of The Pen Addict Podcast, and I got some <a href="<http://www.wellappointeddesk.com/2015/12/link-love-wrapping-it-up-for-2015/>">Ink Love</a> from Ana from The Well Appointed Desk yesterday.

The result is that, a lot more people are subscribing and visiting the site. I donâ€™t really care too much about that, the thing I care about is that people I admire and respect actually like what I have started doing over here.

I can't wait to start the new year, and to publish some of the stuff I have been working on for a very long long time.
