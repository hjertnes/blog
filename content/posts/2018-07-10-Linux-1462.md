For me, there are two different "roles" to a backup system. One is to
make sure you don't loose backups, and another is to make the process of
moving from one drive or hardware to another. On my Mac I have a lot of
stuff that doesn't live in the cloud or anything like that. Which means
that I need a solid backup strategy. My Linux machine on the other hand
doesn't. Everything on it is in Git, and the rest is the system.

The way I decided to back it up, is to clone the system drive with the
"dd" command to an external drive. And I update it every few weeks,
because the system itself doesn't change that often.

If my drive fails now, when there have gone a few weeks since the last
time I cloned it, the process of recovery would be to get a new drive,
clone my backup over to it and then just update the system and the git
repositories.
