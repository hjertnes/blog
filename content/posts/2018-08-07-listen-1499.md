If you really want to get an idea of how people act you need to stop
listenting to what they tell you and watch how they act. Especially when
things don't go like they would like it to go.

For example when you quit or something like that.

It is very easy to say that you do the right thing, and it is easier to
do that when shit go like you would like them to. But how you act when
things go bad is when you get the real picture.

People might say shit like "this company is like family". But my
expereince is that that is only true when it is an advantage for
management or the company.
