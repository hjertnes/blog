I read this article yesterday, when everyone else was linking to it. I
didn't have the time to write anything, but there it is. This is one of
the best things I have read in a very long time.

The quote above is my favourite from the OP-ed.Â Activism isn't for
everyone, but doing something is. What Tim Cook is doing here, is to
sacrifice something that obviously is important to him(privacy), for the
greater cause; that is even more important.

Everyone should read it.

There are still assholes out there that think it's okay to discriminate
people on the color of their skin, their sexual orientation or their
religion(or lack of religion). Seriously. Upgrade your values to 2014.

Everyone is different. Accept it. And embrace it.
