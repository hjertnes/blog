I have been playing around with ClojureScript a lot the last few months.
A lot of it together with React. No matter what you do, use the
"official" [fighwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) lein
template. I used a reagent specific one for a while, and it caused me a
lot of grief. Pick either Reagent or Om(the two most popular
ClojureScript wrappers for React. I personally prefer Reagent because it
feels the closes to regular React.

The official figwheel template works great, no issues with it at all. I
just picked another one because I didn't know what I was doing. It
compiles down to a single JS file. And you can run it through webpack or
other build tools if you want to.
