In general: no.

But because Clojure is built on the JVM, you will sooner or later meet
an situation where you want to do something where there is a Java
Library you can use, but no Clojure library. In these situations you
need to use what is called the Java Interop. The code doesn't look like
Java, but it is useful to know enough Java to take an existing example
and re-write it into Clojure.
