One of my intentions for 2014 was to do the 1Password Audit, every week.
I've always had this as a regular task, but it was more on the monthly,
every three or six months basis. And there are many reasons for me not
recommending that for anyone.

Here is what I have realised when it comes to doing reviews of your
passwords. You need to do it often. And here is why: -- People often
just sign up to services with their old "default" password without
realising it(Yes, I do it too) -- It's more secure -- It's easier to do
and complete a practise where you change 5-10 items once a week, and
take the rest later, than to do it all in one day. The latter
alternative is baffling, boring, and I ended up skipping it half of the
time.

This is by the way a great chance to check out the new iOS 7 re-designed
