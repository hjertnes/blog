I have been a nvAlt user for so long that I can’t even remember when I started. And it is in many ways the perfect note app. Except for it being kind of old, and very hard to make money off because of many GPL related reasons.

I chose to move everything over to Bear, when it came out, to again re-assess everything when Brett Terpstra finally releases BitWriter, the app that is going to replace nvAlt. Bear is a fantastic app in many aspects. It looks good, is easy to use and I have not met any big bugs this far. And having the app both on OS X and iOS makes everything a little bit more convenient. There are many good note taking apps and writing apps for iOS but I have never seen anything that felt natural together with nvAlt.

Is Bear the perfect solution? Far from it. I have one big problem with it, and if BitWriter is more or less identical to bear but solves this problem, then I’ll switch. And that is the combined search and create note feature of nvAlt. It does one thing, you can type in the search field to search for notes and hit enter; if you found anything it will select the note, and if not it will create a new one.

A great feature for power users.

I see the space for both Bear’s solution, which is more user-friendly and more discoverable, and I hope there is also space or room for a real power user alternative, like we had in nvAlt.
