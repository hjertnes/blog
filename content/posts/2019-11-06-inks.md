I have always been a using one ink in all my pens kind of person. But recently I have grown to learn that some pens need much more lubricated inks than others. So, at the moment I have accepted that my Pilot pens always need to be inked up Iroshizuku inks. While my other pens are better with iroshizuku, but anyhting is usually fine.

So at the moment my pilots use Iroshizuku and the rest use the Pen Addict orange ink I got a way back.
