I have seen these free pencils at IKEA every single time I've been
there. Which is too many times.

This pencil is not something I would have bought for myself, it is a
thin, short pencil. The casing does not feel that great. But the core is
prefectly fine. Maybe a little bit too hard for my taste.

When you hear "that free pencil they give away at IKEA" you expect them
to be far worse than what it is.
