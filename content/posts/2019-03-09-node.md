I don't know how many out there remember how it was to do serious web
apps before Node, but it was not great.

There are many big problems with Node, and those of us who have done a
lot of Javascript because we in general like it, know it better than
most.

But, before Node, we did not have a real development enivornment, like
in most other languages. There was no real "test runners" or package
management systems.

What you did was that you had a bunch of JavaScript files, maybe you had
some git submodules for the third party stuff, and either some script or
symlink thing that put it into place.

This was the same era as when RequireJS was the most advanced way to
deal with depenencies. It was basically just a function you passed a
list of files into, and told it to load them before running a callback
that was your code.

I remember more than once getting into situations where things you
really fucked up if jQuery plugin C loaded before B, because they wrote
to some of the same global namespace.

Node is not perfect, but a lot better than things were before it, and it
is also getting better.
