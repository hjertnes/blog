I’m a little bit more interesting in backup than the average person because I did lose a lot of data, including all the pictures I took before 2006 or something. And I am a strong believer in having a cloud copy of all your important data. It doesn’t have to be a “backup”, but I recommend it, but Dropbox could be good enough for many people.

It was three obvious options when I came up with my previous online backup strategy:

<pre><code>- Use Dropbox if you just want a online copy of your data

-   Use Backblaze if you want a “set it and forget it” type solution.

-   Use Crashplan if you have more complicated requirements; like backing up external drives or network storage.

My storage requirements used to fairly simple, but after close to five years of using a DSLR, my raw files take up far more storage than I want to pay for on a MacBook Pro.

The way I have been doing it up this point is to use Backblaze for everything on my SSD, and upload a copy of “archival stuff” to Dropbox. But I started to investigate other solutions this summer, because it had become way too cumbersome. And I wanted to have a single solution for everything.

Backblaze is a great app, and I think it is the best option for most people. But it is a little bit too hard to make it do exactly what you want, if you are a little bit picky.

So, I decided to look at Mac OS software that backs up to Amazon Glacier. Glacier is either a service or a storage class for S3 (another service) where it is very cheap to upload and store data, but more expensive (and slower) to receive data. In other words, it is cheaper than S3, if you only upload data and don’t access it that often. Which is exactly what I need for a backup solution.

I tired Freeze and then Arq; but ended up sticking with Arq because it was much more mature and rock solid. After using Arq on my MacBook to backup both the internal storage and an external archive drive, I have no big complaints about it. It was all the features you would expect from a premium backup application. But I do miss a pause function that isn’t based on time; some times I just want to pause it until I resume. And the drive scanning is a little bit slow.
