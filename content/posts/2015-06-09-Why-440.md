I rarely write much about Android, because I don't are. But this is
important.

Android cameras suck. Seriously, they suck. And there are many reasons
for it, first of all, hardware is only half of it. You need to make sure
that the software layer can convert the raw data from the sensor into a
good looking JPEG.

The problem with Android isn't hardware, but software. Good cameras can
generate bad JPEG's. Some phones do it, and some compact cameras do it,
and many DSLR's generate horrible JPEG's.

This is why I shoot RAW, I can edit, and let someone I trust generate
the JPEG -- Adobe.
