Popsockets are this thing you glue to the back of your phome that you can pull out or collapse so that you have something to hold onto that does't bulge out a lot when you pocket your phone.

They look kind of weird, but I am really enojoying using them. They have multiple versions, I'm using the kind you can twist off so wireless charging still works.

What a popsocket gives you is a easier way to hold modern larger smartphones, you can kind of just let the popsocket rest between your fingers and you don't have to grip it. I have noticted that I'm enojoying hold my phone way more, I have less pain in my wirst when I use my phone a lot and I' almost never tired in my hand because of it.

They are not expensive, and I'd give it a shot. I didn't think I would like it before ordering some, but now I can't imagine having a phone without.
