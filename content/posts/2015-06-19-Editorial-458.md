I have been a Editorial users since the app came out, first on iPad, and
then on iPhone one year later.

Editorial is a really powerful app, and you can make it do more or less
everything, but you don't need to install any workflows to have a very
good iOS text editor.

I love the fact that you can use it for almost everything, and that I
can use it for what I need at the moment out of the box: Dropbox plain
text notes, and task paper files.

And I love the slow update cycle, it is once a year. Which is slow, but
the app is so solid. I have never met any problem with it.
