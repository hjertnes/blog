Great post about backup strategy. My strategy is simple:

Have one clone, one Time Machine and one cloud backup of your computer.
And then make a clone of each of your archive disks.

[Superduper!](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html)
is a great app for cloning disks, and
[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) is a fantastic cloud backup
solution.
