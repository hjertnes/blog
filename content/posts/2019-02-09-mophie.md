I've been a huge fan of powerbanks for years. They kind of changed how I
think about using battery powered devices. Suddenly you're not limited
to the built in battery or having to sit next to the power outlet while
it charges.

I ordered a new powerbank in the beginning of December. It is made by
Mophie, it's just called XXL. The main feature of it is that it is a
real USB-C powerbank. You can charge it with your MacBook Pro USB-C
power brick and it will take advantage of the power of it. And you can
also charge anything USB-C, like the Swithc or even a MacBook.

It also comes with a A style port.

What I love about this thing is that it charges from empty to full way
faster than anyhting I have owned. And it can charge anything USB I own.
It have made by travel powerbrick situation a lot simpler.
