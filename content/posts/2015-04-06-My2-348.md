Jim don't write that many long form pieces, but I always love them. This
one is about the iPad, it is fantastic, and you should read it.

I have a long and difficult relationship with it. I can use my iPad for
almost everything. Except for software development and photography.

I use my Mac for almost everything, it is easier. But I always bring my
iPad everywhere. I use it to read pdf's and e-books, and I use it to
play games and read RSS; for example when my iPhone runs out of battery.

My only dissapointment with the iPad is at the software side. And all of
it is because of Apple. They have never delivered a iOS version for the
iPad that doesn't feel like a streched out iPhone OS.

Anyways. I love the iPad, even though I never thought it had such a big
place in my day to day computing life.
