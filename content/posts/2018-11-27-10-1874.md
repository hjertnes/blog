I think this is a horrible idea, my experience from working on HUGE
monoliths are that it is a bad idea. You end up with huge projects that
are hard if not impossible to break up, that are so big that almost all
development tools are in a constant limbo between running and crashing
every single time you do anything. And you end up being really annoyed
because everything is really slow
