[Relay.fm](http://www.relay.fm/) have been running for a while now,
and I thought it was about time to write about their shows, and why you
should listen to them.

-   **[Analog(ue)](http://www.relay.fm/analogue).** Was a brand new show
    at Relay.fm. This is one of my favorite new shows this year. Myke
    Hurley and Casey Liss, from [ATP](http://atp.fm) talk about all the
    "touchy feely" things. It's a great show.

-   **[BONANZA!](http://www.relay.fm/bonanza)**. This is new show on
    Relay. It's hosted by Myke Hurley and Matt Alexander. This show picks
    up, where Bionic left off. The only word that could describe it weird.
    The good kind.

-   **[Clockwize](http://www.relay.fm/clockwise)** used to be a IDG show,
    and was brought over to Relay when Jason Snell left Macworld. It's a
    short show, with two regular and two guest hosts. A great concept. And
    a great show.

-   **[Connected](http://www.relay.fm/connected)** started as the 512
    podcasts, and was renamed The Prompt when 70Decibels moved to 5by5,
    and Federico Viticci from [MacStories](http://macstories.net) joined
    the show. It's one of my favorite tech shows.

-   **[Inquisitive](http://www.relay.fm/inquisitive)** is the next
    incarnation of Myke's interview show. It started out as The Brow Show,
    then CMD+Space. This is without doubt one of the best interview shows
    out there.

-   **[The Pen Addict](http://www.relay.fm/penaddict)** is the show for
    everyone that likes stuff like pen and paper. Brad Dowdy of
    [PenAddict.com](http://penaddict.com) is the Gruber of pen and
    paper. You should check it out, if you have any interest in pen and
    paper; or if you want to get into it.

-   **[Upgrade](http://www.relay.fm/upgrade)** was another new show right
    after the network launched. Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talk about
    tech. My only thought when it launched was -- finally. Jason Snell is
    a brilliant writer. And this have become one of my favorite shows.

-   **[Virtual](http://www.relay.fm/virtual)**. I'm not really into
    gaming. But you should check out Virtual if you are. I listen to it
    now and then. Frederico and Myke talk about gaming.
