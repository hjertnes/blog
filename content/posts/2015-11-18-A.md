I was in the middle of planning a beginners guide to fountain pens; it was one of the posts I was going to have here on day one. Then I found this article from <a href="http://penaddict.com">The Pen Addict</a>. So, I deleted it.

  I have always loved the look and the mystique of fountain pens. As a writer, I have a sentimental attachment to the written word, and all things that go with it. I’ve always had a bizarre fascination with stationery stores. I own far too many notebooks, and while you would have to drag me kicking and screaming into a shopping mall, I’ll happily spend money on office supplies. As such, maybe it was a foregone conclusion that I would some day grow fond of fountain pens.
