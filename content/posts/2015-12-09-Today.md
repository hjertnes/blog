  My plan for celebrating the day (which, truthfully, I started last night) is to open up past yearâ€™s journals, logs, and notes and tease out any ideas that may have gotten lost in the shuffle and see what I might want to put into action the coming year. On August 10, 2014 I noted that my wife and I were a pretty good canoe team after a jaunt out on the lake at our family cabin and that, perhaps, we should go canoeing more often here in town. There are plenty of lakes with canoe rental in town and it would be a lovely way to spend some more time together. I had forgotten this so, now, I can make it a part of my intentions for the coming year.
