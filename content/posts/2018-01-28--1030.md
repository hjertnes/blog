I start to think about the ethics of using some rhetorical devices every
time I use some of them like sarcasm or over exaggeration to make a
point and someone don't understand it.

Part of my personality is to talk in a way where one should not read
what I write or hear what I say sentence by sentence. This means that
you will probably not understand what I'm talking about, if you do so.

For example yesterday, when I compared using Windows or Android to the
torture of a really strict diet. Does this mean that I would rather go
on a really strict diet than using Windows? No.Â It just means that
Windows(and Android) is my least favourite operating system. And when I
say "Visual Studio is the only acceptable reason to use Windows", this
means that I think it is acceptable to use Windows when there are some
really good piece of software that you need that only run on Windows.

On one side is it not fair to the world that I talk and write in a way
they don't understand. But on the other side: is it fair to me that I
hide or edit part of my personality away?
