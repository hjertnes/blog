I love this keyboard, but it might not be for you.

The HHKB is a compact mechanical keyboard. The keys are normal size, but
some keys, like arrows, F-keys and various others are only available
under the Fn key, and the Control key have been moved to where most
keyboards have the Caps Lock key.

I love this keyboard and everything about it, because it feels great to
type on, the size makes it very easy to bring everywhere I bring a
laptop. The width of it is basically the same as a 13" laptop. But the
alternate layout might not work for you. If you like my prefer to spend
all day in Emacs or VIM for that matter, then it is not a problem.
Because you don't use the arrow, home, end, page up / down keys for
much. But if you use something like BBEdit or Visual Studio Code you
might not find it to be the best.

It is a UNIX keyboard, with some strong ties to how the keyboards of the
old LISP Machines had. Like I said, it works great for me. And I love it
so much that I am bringing it back and forth to work until I get around
to ordering a second one
