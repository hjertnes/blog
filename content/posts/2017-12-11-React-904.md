One of the first things I wrote down in my notebook as I was planning or
trying to figure out if there was enough stuff to write about to do this
site was a React introduction. I know React fairly well, and have been
working full time with it for quite a while now. I'm not sure how many
things there will be to write about React. But I assume there will be a
few weeks with React related content.

I'm going to start with basics and then move on to more advanced topics
and try to cover the different aspects one have to consider writing an
React app. This will also be a excellent opportunity for me to learn the
various parts of React I personally don't use.

The goal at the end of this small or large series of posts will be that
you know everything you need to know to build from small apps to large
apps; with or without server side rendering.
