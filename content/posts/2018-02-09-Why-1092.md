I have been using Overcast for all of my podcast playing since the day
Marco released it. And while I have tested out other apps since then I
have stayed with Overcast, for the same reason I stayed with Instapaper
all the time I used a dedicated read it later service (I use Pinboard
these days). The reason is not about features, because most of the apps
have more or less the same features these days. But instead it is about
the design of the app.

Overcast has great design. But it isn't the most beautiful app, and it
isn't a turd either. There are four widely used podcasting apps on iOS,
as far as I can see. Overcast, Podcast, PocketCast and Castro. I have
only launched the official apple app once, and I have less than zero
interest in it. PocketCast is a great app, but the design is not my kind
of thing. It feels way too much like a Windows or Android app for me.
And Castro on the other hand is too much in the pretty over usability
camp.

Overcast is minimal, but still looks great. And is very easy to use.
