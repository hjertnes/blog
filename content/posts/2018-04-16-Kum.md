I ordered a Kum Automatic long point pencil sharpener with Blackwing
branding at the same time as I ordered my first box of Blackwings. It
cost about $7.50 at JetPens. It has two holes, numbered, you use the
first one to shape the wood, it will stop shaving off wood when you're
done and then you use the second hole to sharpen the tip.

I got this one because it was not too expensive, and I hoped that the
blackwing branding on it was a sign of quality. It works great. I don't
have any complaints about it, it sharpens my pencils every single time.
Without any issues. The only think I wish was different is more space
for shavings.

I'm probably going to get a couple more of them. This is the sharpener
you want if you want a long point sharpener and only care about the
utility of it.
