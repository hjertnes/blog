Interesting. I have been expecting this for a while now. Facebook
Messenger is my favorite messaging app, especially after the
[Messenger.com](http://messenger.com) web app came out. Messenging
will be the next big thing after Social Networks, and Facebook knows
that, and they are trying to get that market by allowing everyone --
Facebook user or not use their platform.
