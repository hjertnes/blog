I have gone through many phases of where I get my books. All physical,
all e-book etc. These days I get digital, if possible or practical. I
try to get as many books as possible in a non-drm outside Amazon and
Apple form, when possible. Because then I am free to read them however I
feel like.

After that, my go to place is Kindle, unless it is some kind of content
that I know will work better on iBooks. I don't think Kindle is better
than iBooks in general, but they are available more places. Something
that have made my life easier a few times over the years.
