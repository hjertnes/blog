I have gone over a week without the Apple Watch now, and I don't miss charging it, or having constant access to push notifications on my wrist.

But there are some features of the Watch that I miss, most of it have been replaced by various Shortcuts and other stuff. What I miss is:

-   Playback control: to be able to play, pause, skip etc on the Watch was one of my favorite features.
-   Timers: I miss how fast and easy it was to manage them
-   Due and Drafts: two of very few apps that is awesome

At the moment I don't plan to get back into it, but I might if I continue to miss the features.
