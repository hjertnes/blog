Tsuki-yo is my third Iroshizuku ink, and it will without doubt not be my last.

```text
The thing I love about Iroshizuku inks is how consistent they are. I know more or less how the dry time will be, how it is to write with them, and how they perform. This makes it much easier to find a new ink. I just need to find a colour I like.

```text
Tsuki-yo is my first blue ink. The reason I have ignored blue inks for so long is that is my distaste for what I call “bic blue”. This is the colour that you get in most cheap ball point pens, or in the cartridge you get in the box when you buy a Pilot Metropolitan or Lamy Safari.

One of my goals this year was to explore more ink colour than what I have done in the past. And a natural step in this direction is to try more blues.

I have used Tsuki-yo with all of my pens. It delivers a darker, but still not muddy blue colour when I use it with a wetter pen, like my Lamy 2000. And it delivers a lighter but not washed out colour when I use it with one of my dryer pens.

My experience this far with the Iroshizuku line of inks is that how they behave with wet versus dry nibs are very consistent. Wet nib – darker colour without being muddy; dry nib – lighter colour without being washed out.
