I have defended Apple's 30% cut many times in the past. But this is a
area where I think they are wrong. Apple should be able to get a cut,
and a cut that is larger than what credit card compaines get, but I
still believe that services that are in direct competition with Apple,
like Spotify, Kindle, or Dropbox should be able to get more than 70% and
they should be able to link to other means of purchase than iAP.
