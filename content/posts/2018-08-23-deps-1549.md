A recent addition to the Clojure Universe is the new "deps.edn" file.
This is a edn formatted file that define the dependencies of a project.
I think it looks like a great system, but I'm not going to move over to
it, at least not yet. Because I'm a happy user of lein. It might look
like this is the same thing on the surface. But while lein does what
deps.edn does, lein also does a lot more.

Both of them have a project template system, and both of them keeps
track of a projects dependencies. Where the difference comes in is when
it comes to a complete project system.

Because lein let's you create projects using existing templates, and
there are a lot of them and manage dependencies like deps. But it also
supports adding pre defined commands to make it easier to run a
development server or building for production.

I'm sticking with lein for now, but I would love to see lein move to
using deps.edn to manage just the dependencies, or that Clojure Core
exxtended their offering to cover more of what lein offers today.
