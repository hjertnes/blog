There are two different parts, when we are talking about coding a web
browser. You have the language: JavaScript and you have the API: DOM.
Most people are often using either their own or a third party library or
set of library to work with the DOM. I do for example use Axios to deal
with requests against RESTful API's because it is kind of cumbersome to
do so directly. The other reason for doing this is to leave it to a
third party library to deal with differences between browsers (this
problem have for the most part gone away).

The DOM is designed by a committee, and it is designed to be as flexible
as possible to make sure that all kinds of Web Applications can be
developed. That means that the DOM is often not the easiest to use. This
does not mean that the DOM sucks or anything like that. It just means
that it is there to solve many different problems and use cases. And I
believe that it is really good at what it attempts to do. This does not
mean that front end developers should use the DOM api's all day or
ignore them.

You should probably use libraries to deal with the DOM most of the time.
While at the same time do some projects where you use it directly. So
that you know how it works.
