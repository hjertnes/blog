Looks great. But, I'm staying with Alfred.

This is the great thing about Alfred, you don't need any custom API's or
anything like that. You can just drag and drop stuff, and use more or
less any script with it. One of the reasons I got really into Alfred,
and never got into LaunchBar or QuickSilver is that Alfred is
uncomplicated by design, while the others required an investment I
wasn't willing to do.

It is good to see that LaunchBar are trying to make it easier, but they
still have a long way to go.
