[Launch Center Pro](http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/), is one of
the apps I just never got started with. I have had it installed on my
phone more or less all the time since it launched. But I have never
found a use for it.

One of the things I have done, and still do a lot on my phone is to
launch a few different sites. Everything from every few days, to many
times a day. These are sites like [Facebook](http://facebook.com),
[Fastmail](http://fastmail.com), my university e-mail address, and a
few other university related sites. The common factor for all of them is
that I need [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to log in,
but I don't want to stay logged in.

I might be lazy. But I hate typing those URL's all the time.

My solution to the problem is to use LCP as a glorified bookmark
"launcher" for 1Password.

The problem with my needs and LCP was, and is that the there are not
much between what [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/) +
[TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) or
[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) +
[TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) can
do, that LCP would be a elegant solution for.

Check out LCP if you look for a fast way for opening a predefined set of
urls in 1Password.
