As a coder or a apiring one you have probably experienced many moments
where all the smokes blows away and you understand something much
clearer. One of these moments for me was when I was introduced to
recoursion. Probably, while learning Scheme or Haskell. The basic idea
is that a function calls itself. Don't use recoursion when you write
definitions, because circularity is **BAD** philosophy.

Here is a very simple example that loops over an array, and prints the
result, without using a regular loop; like while, for, do, map, forEach
etc.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/9c19b591a0f23ec7161e3c0f3a2bb1fe.js>"></script>

</div>

You could of course do the same with a for of for example:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/fe0cae257363780978f2fb5529e6bf40.js>"></script>

</div>

To figure out how to do something, without using the "default" is always
a very good exercise. The basic idea above is to print the first
element, and re-run the function if, the input is larger than one with
the array minus the first element as input.
