Maton Reece just announced that
[Sunlit 1.2](http://www.manton.org/2014/05/sunlit%5F12.html) is
available in the App Store.

I haven't commented on the App.net happenings yet. Not because I didn't
have anything to say, but mainly because a lot of other people said more
or less what I was thinking.

But there is one thing I would like to say. I don't think I'll spend
much time on App.net as a social network. But I would pay for App.net if
there was more apps like Sunlit out there.

Let me explain. I would pay $3 a month(or whatever what it is) if there
was more apps(that I'm interested in) that used it as their sync
platform.

I hope that App.net survives. And I might even renew my subscription if
I end up using Sunlit more than I do today.

Sunlit is basically like DayOne for sharing photos with your friends and
family. In other words a combination of a journal and a photo gallery.
