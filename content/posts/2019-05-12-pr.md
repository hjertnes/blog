There are two major ways to work with git that I am aware of, you either work directly on a branch, that means that everyone commits to the main branch (usually master) and then pushes changes directly to it. Or you work on "feature" branches, create a pull request for it, and someone reviews it and then you merge that into master.

I think Pull Requests are useful even for very small teams because it is a very simple way to do code reviews. That makes it easy to point out dumb mistakes we all make, give good tips or point out things we didn't think about. Or to give your team mates grief for not writing tests.

Personally am I also a huge fan of deploying a PR, then merge it into master, so that the pull request are deployed all the way to production. It is the best way I know of to keep enviornments stable.
