I think there is a maximum number of pens I can keep in rotation. For me
is it around five. Because there is only so many pens you can write with
regularly before you have to spend a lot of time making sure they don't
dry up.

When I got my Metal Falcon I decided to empty, clean and stop having my
two Pilot Metropolitans as a part of my daily carry. This is kind of
weird, because up to this point all of the pens I enjoy using have been
a part of my rotation. But the truth is that I enjoy all the other pens
in my rotation a lot more. And seven pens is a little bit too much.
