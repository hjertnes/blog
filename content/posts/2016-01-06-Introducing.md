  My decision to do this did not come lightly. I quit my day job – a job I have held for the majority of the past 15 years – because I believe in this site, I believe in the readers, and I want to continue spreading the stationery word. It would be an honor if you would consider supporting me and The Pen Addict as I take this on full time. Along with Nock Co., I am all in on analog and am comitting myself to this world and to you.
