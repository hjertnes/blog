There are probably a community that care fiercely about more or less anything from anal lube to shampoo; and anything in between. But don’t mix them up.

Let’s start by putting my Philosophy Major to use. What I mean by “geekdom” here is limited to every day items; like a camera, pen or headphones. Some people get hooked on the relationship between knowing all the details, or as much as possible and finding the “perfect”. While many care about quality, without becoming a geek.

I care about quality in general because I would rather get a quality product that is more reliably and will last longer(and often so long that I don’t remember when or where I bought it), than some cheap piece of shit that I have to replace many times per year.

Am I a kettle geek? No. I just search only until I find the one that seems like the best fit for what I want and need from a kettle. Which is way more than what most people would want from a kettle, since I’m into coffee and tea. And buy the one that the reviewers agree on being the best one.

I blame parts of my deep dive into stationary on the Moleskine marketing department. But that came a little bit later.

It all started when I realised how much time I spent writing with pen and paper. But I don’t enjoy using them. The pens I was using was driving me nuts. And the paper was crap.

I don’t remember 100%, but from it all went very fast. In one moment I was using what ever pens was laying around the office and printer paper to using Pilot G2’s and Moleskines in a very short time span. I don’t remember which came first, or if both came at the same time. But I know that I picked up both while buying some book, and had to walk past the stationary section to pay for the damn thing.

Jump forward two years, and it happens. I went deep. This was when I discovered there was a whole community out there, and that I could get something much better. This was the when I started to look for the best pens and notebooks for what I used them for.

There is a difference between the two groups of people that care. One of them just want something good, while the other are also interested. If you just want something good, buy a Mont Blanc. But you can also find something as good, or even better, for way less money if you want to put in some time, to do the research.
