This blog have been, and is my favorite creative outlet. It's the best
thing I have ever done.

What this blog have been up to this point is a more or less unedited raw
version of good ideas I had. I don't think I have spent more time on
most of them, than the time it took to write it. And then a quick
glance, and minor tweaks.

I decided to change that a few months ago. I decided, but I didn't do
it. Yet.

This is the last post I will write, before I start to focus more on
editing and to focus on making every single post as good as they can be.

I know I should have done the change earlier. And I also know that it is
something I had to do sooner or later.
