> I've been testing Shut Up for iOS 9 over the summer, and it's the
> Content Blocker I prefer for hiding comments. What I like about Shut
> Up is that, besides being based on Frank's stylesheet and working well
> for the websites I visit, it offers a whitelist to specify websites
> where you do want to see comments -- either because they usually have
> great conversations, or because they're meant to be read as "comments"
> (such as Facebook or Reddit threads). Shut Up comes with a built-in
> list of allowed sites, and it also detects URLs in your clipboard when
> you open the app, letting you easily whitelist its domain.

Fantastic!
