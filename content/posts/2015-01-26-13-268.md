Ana, of The Well Appointed Desk writes about 13 ways to use some of your
unused notebooks. A fantastic post. This is one of the areas where I'm
kind of different from most other pen and paper geeks. I don't have a
lot of unused notebooks. I use so much pen and paper, all the time. I
have the opposite problem, I run out all the time.
