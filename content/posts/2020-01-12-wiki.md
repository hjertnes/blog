I have spent the [wiki](https://wiki.hjertnes.blog) re-organizing my wiki, and adding some features and fixing some bugs I introduced this weekend. Also updated some stuff. All of it have been on my list of a while. The next thing will be to go through everything and update it.

My main focus moving forward will be my wiki, and most of my writing will be there and not this blog. The reason is that I'm less and less interested in the single timeline a blog has. Instead I'm more and more interested in adding small pages in nester hierarchies, nested together with tags. Some of it will be kept up to date, while others will not.

Something I feel about blogging in 2020 is that the main focus is "now", while the whole body of work is much more hidden, and most of us spend little time looking at the body of posts. A large part of this is a design problem. Something I am trying to do something different with on my wiki.
