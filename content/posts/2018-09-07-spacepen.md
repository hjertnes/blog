I have no idea how many times I have almost ordered this little black
bullet Spacepen. It is a lot.

I finally did it, and it is awesome. It is the best pocket pen I have
owned. It is very small, but it becomes large enough to be comfortable
when you post it.

It is very well built, it comes without a clip, but I recommend that you
order one with your pen, because I almost lost it a lot before I got
mine.

The only thing I do not like about this pen is the refill. I would
change over to the refill from the Retro 51 right now, if I could find
one that fits.

Get this pen if you want something really solid that just works, that is
made to be small, and pocketable.
