Haha! Good one. I have been going back and forth on this a few times,
but I have come to the conclusion that
[Existential Comics](http://existentialcomics.com) is a good "starter
drug" for people that are interested in Philosophy, because you can
always get the explaination at the bottom of the page. And remember: go
back and read some of the originals, they are great.
