I love Org-mode and I love Taskpaper. But I like each one for different
reasons.

Taskpaper as a file format works much better for me, than the org-mode
format. But I think org-mode as a piece of software is much more
powerful and is much better when it comes to management. In other words:
I prefer writing in the taskpaper format, but org mode is more fun to
use.

I have written a very simple
[python](https://github.com/hjertnes/tp2org) script to convert
taskpaper formatted text to org-mode formatted text in order to make it
a little bit easier for me to use both.
