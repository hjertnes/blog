My current Mac and work device is a 2013 Macbook Air, it have been with me through a lot, but I need to replace it as soon as humanly possible. The battery is dead and it starts to feel a little “funky” after over three and half years of service. I can still use it for everything I need to, but it isn’t as fast as it used to or should be, and sometimes when I push my luck, the cpu overheats.

I started to look for a replacement 10 months ago. Then I concluded that I would get a new one when my current machine died or when Apple released new Macbooks; whichever came first. Then I hoped for a refresh in March or April, or at WWDC at the latest. Instead we got them a few weeks ago.

The machines are very interesting, and I think they are the future. Sometimes we go through easy transitions like when we lost the DVD Drive or harder ones like when we lost the Floppy drive. This is obviosuly one of the harder ones. I personally had a lot of philosophial and practical problems when we lost the Firefire 400 and Firewire 800 port; I still miss that little bastard.

I’m ordering a 13” Macbook Pro with 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of ram as soon as I can make it happen.

This line of Macbooks are frustrating for a number of reasons, and none of it has to do with the ports. For me it comes down to the lack of Magsafe, I get why, but I still wish Apple had made it work in some way.

The available configurations of the new Macbook Pro’s are a little bit weird. One one side you have the new one(with touch bar), that is expensive, but still kind of okay. And then you have the cheaper model without the touch bar that feels very expensive when you look at what you get. The Macbook Pro without the Escape key is very limited, the processor is much slower and you only get two USB-C ports. Now, I think it could become an interesting product in the future if the price goes down.

I think it will be a rough period in front of us, until the world catches up to the USB-C future that Apple has decided to go down. I’m going to miss the SD slot, and I’m going to miss the Magsafe. But I’m also a little bit dissapointed. I really hoped for 32 GB of Ram(I know that the notebook chipsets aren’t there yet) and cheaper SSD storage.
