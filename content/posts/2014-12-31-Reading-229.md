> Sometimes I randomly grab a journal and read a few pages. I often have
> no recollection of the events I wrote about. I just pulled out 1995

> mare over on Dec. 18. I noted it was a big struggle to geld those
> horses as they had never been touched. I kept two of them here and
> started breaking them to ride on Dec. 20. I must have been hard up for
> money as there are no indoor arenas on this place and it is seldom fun
> to break colts wearing overshoes.
