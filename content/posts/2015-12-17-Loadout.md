This is my first loadout posts. I was planning to do one last month, but never go around to it. My daily carry stuff this month contain a few new items.

  <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/">Field Notes</a> is as always the corner stone of my note taking and productivity; I use them for shorter notes and tasks.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://www.1101.com/store/techo/2016/planner/detail_cover/c_hpr.html">Hobonichi Planner 2015</a> is the second and last part of my productivity. I have used this baby since the beginning of March. I use it to keep track of meetings, other events and the most important tasks; in other words: the high level stuff that I absolutely need to complete at any given day. I also use it to write up monthly goals. I ordered the 2015 version a week ago.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Fountain-Pen-Medium-Nib-Black-Plain-Body/pd/10177">Pilot Metropolitain</a>(I think it is a medium nib, but I got it back when there was only one kind of nib for it). Iâ€™m not using this pen at lot anymore. But it is still the pen I reach for when the two following items run out of ink.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-2000-Fountain-Pen-Medium-Nib-Black-Body/pd/9187">Lamy 2000: medium nib</a> this have been the pen that I have written 99% of everything I have written in 2015. I use it a little bit less at the moment, because I just got the next pen on the list. But this will remain one of my go to pens.

</li>

<li>

  All of the three pens above is inked up with: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iroshizuku-Ink-50-ml-Take-sumi-Bamboo-Charcoal-Black/pd/9973">Pilot Take-sumi</a>. I usually use one ink until I run out. I got this ink two days ago, and I think it is great.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://www.gouletpens.com/twsbi-diamond-580al-fountain-pen-silver-broad/p/TW-M7444270">TWSBI Diamond 580AL Silver: medium nib</a> this have been my go to pen since I got it two days ago. And I love almost everything about it.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://nockco.com/cases/hightower">Nock.co Hightower</a>: this thing is just fantastic. I bring it everywhere, it is always filled up with three pens(the three pens above) and three Field Notes.

</li>

<li>

  <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Midori-Traveler-s-Notebook-Starter-Kit-Regular-Size-Brown-Leather/pd/13623">Midori Travelers Notebook: with lined refills</a>. This became my new favourite notebook within minutes after packing it up. I love how it looks, and everything else about it. I use it for journaling, and everything else I write long form.
