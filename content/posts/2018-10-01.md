My current daily carry is a little bit larger than usual because I am
trying some stuff out at the moment. But I hope to have things back to
normal by the time I do the next one of these.

In my pocket I carry a Bullet Spacepen, with a clip on it, a pocket
sized notebook, and a Nock.co Talluah filled with Nock.co Index Cards,
and two TWSBI Eco.

The stuff I carry in my bag is still a lot like always, my good old
Hightower filled with a couple of fresh Field Notes, three pens (Pilot
Vanishing Point, Lamy 2000 and Pilot Metal Falcon), a KUM Masterpiece
sharpener. I have recently started to use a Nock.co Pencil case, that I
love, I usually have it filled with around 24 pencils, Currently Golden
Bears.

My current notebook setup is a little bit in the middle of a change. I'm
filling up my last Leuchtturm1917 notebooks as we are speaking, and I
plan to start using Travelers Notebooks again. This is because now that
I can get them from Norway, I can save a not unsigficiant amount of
money on notebooks.
