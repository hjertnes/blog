Chose the CMS that is right for you. Pick Squarespace if you want
something that "just works".

There are a few important things I think everyone should consider before
picking a cms. Are there any similar CMS they could "just move over to"?
And do they have good export options?

This is the reason I don't like Tumblr. There are nothing like it, and
you are kind of fucked if you for some reason need to move over to
something else.

I use WordPress. I don't love it, but it's the best thing available for
me -- right now. I can post from Byword both on OS X and iOS. And
wordpress plus a few plugins gives me everything I need.

And close to any web host can host a WordPress site.

The only thing I know for certain is that I will go over to a static cms
at some point. It might be this summer, it might be later. I just need
to find the one that's right for me. And then solve a few issues I know
about. Like blogging from my phone.

I chose WordPress because of the great clients available for it. And
that's kind of the main issue about static blogging engines right now.

Time will show.

Happy Blogging
