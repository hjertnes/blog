I start to get really fucking sick of all the electron app bitching in the Apple community. 

If you think something is bad just because it is an electron app you're a fucking moron. 

How an app is made isn't that relevant. Native vs web based versus native but using cross platform things like Xamarin or React Native isn't important for how the end result will be. There are minor differences between each. And each of them have benefits. 

Most of them are around business requirements or personal preferences. Plus that some stuff are easier to do in a web based app, while other things are easier in native apps. But at the end of the day making a great app is never easy. 

What makes something good or bad is not bad native vs web, but rather designing a good user experience and sweating all the details and a lot of focus making it work well.
