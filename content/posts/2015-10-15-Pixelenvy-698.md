The Facebook App both on iOS and Android have always been horrible,
slow, use a lot of batter etc. This is one of the reasons I love the
Messenger app, I can talk with people on Facebook without having to use
the app. I just go to the website if I need to do something there. And I
can notice the difference in batter drain if it is installed or not;
usage is irrelevant.

Their schemes to do stuff in the background even if the user doesn't
allow it is crappy. And Apple _should_ do something about it. This is
bullshit.
