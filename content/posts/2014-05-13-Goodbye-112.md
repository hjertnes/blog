Goodbye Rdio. So, I have moved back to Spotify.

I was a Spotify user from 2009 until sometime in 2012. And then I moved
to Rdio.

There was two reasons for leaving Spotify back in 2012. The lack of
saving albums, without playlists and how ugly and buggy their apps was.

Saving albums, is something Spotify are supporting now. Which is great.
I still think that the way Rdio are doing this on their iOS apps are
superior to Spotify.

But. The current design of the Spotify apps are way superior to Rdio. My
impression is that Spotify is a company that moves all the time, while
Rdio is more or less stuck. I haven't seen many changes in design of
functionality since I started using Rdio; or even since I first tried
Rdio a year before that.

The thing I love the most about Spotify is how fast their sync is. You
can't even compare the two
