This is the reason I'm sticking with Lightroom, version 6 is out around
two years after the previous one. I know I can trust Adobe to improve on
it.

The new version have some cool stuff:

-   HDR Merging

-   Panorama merging

-   Better filters

-   And much more.

I will be upgrading as soon as my budget allows it.
