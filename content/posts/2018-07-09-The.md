I just sharpened three pencils with my new KUM Master Piece.

I'm coming from another KUM sharpener, the "Long Point Sharpener". The
basics are the same, both have two holes to let you get a long point on
your pencils.

The big difference between the two is that the Long Point is made out of
plastic, while the Master Point is made out of metal; and that the Long
Point is boxed in and making it easier to use when you don't have
garbage can available, while the Master Piece does not.

I would not say that the Master Piece is "better", the perfect version
would be the best from both. But the build quality of the Master Piece
is awesome. I can't really describe how good it feels in your hand. But
I got the same feeling that I had the first time I twisted a Retro 51.

The thing I don't like about the Long Point sharpener is that it is too
easy to break it, if you unscrew the blades. You know plastic and metal
screws are often a mess. This will not be a problem with the Master
Piece.

There are not that much to say about this sharpener. It sharpens your
pencils well. It is well built, and not that expensive.
