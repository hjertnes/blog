The process of getting rid of Lightroom from my photography workflow
started a week ago, and today I imported and processed my first round of
images using the new workflow end to end. I could not be happier. The
photos looks great, and it was really qucik. I just copied both SD cards
into my Mac while reading some e-mail. Then I started the import of the
JPEG's to photos and by the time I had walked Luna and done some yoga I
could process them on the phone.

My photopraphy process for as long as I have owned a camera that can
shoot raw files have been to shoot raw, and then import it into
Lightroom. Then waiting for it to do its thing before processing them.
And then export it into Photos or Dropbox back in the day.

The problem with this workflow is that it only really works on my Mac.
And all of it is slow. Also: I never have the time to do anything that
justifies dealing with raw files.

So my solution now is to shoot JPEG+RAW on my Fuji. JPEG's on one card
and raw on the other. I keep the raw files just in case, and then I
import the JPEG's as is into Photos.

I love this process this far because: - It's fun and easy - Really
fast - And I kind of prefer the look of Fuji's film simulations to what
I have ever managed to get out of Lightroom.
