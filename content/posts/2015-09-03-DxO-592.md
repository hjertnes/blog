The DxO One is a fantastic idea. I have been a fan since I first saw it.
And I think it is a must for everyone that love taking pictures with
their phone, that want better pictures. It is not for me, though.

I love taking pictures with a real camera, and that is why I'm still
going to buy a Fujifilm X100T instead of a DxO. But I know tons of
people that should go for this inead of a proper camera.

Too bad it's not available outside the US.
