Facebook released a new app a few days ago. It's called
[Slingshot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slingshot/id878681557?mt=8).

A lot of people around the internet have posted some far from favourable
reviews.

I kind of disagree with them.

First of all, the app looks much better than Snapchat. And they avoided
to implement the most annoying part of Snapchat, the timer. The fact
that you have to send a picture back before being able to view the
pictures someone sends you is weird.

But, it's a fun app. It's more fun than Snapchat. And it might stick.
