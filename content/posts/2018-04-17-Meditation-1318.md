I have been trying to get into meditation for years. Reading countless
books and blogposts about it. But it wasn't before I started to use the
Headspace app this year that I got into it. The guided content they have
are really awesome. No focus on all the weird stuff like sitting is not
a part of it.

One of the things that always was hard to understand from my previous
attempt was what was optional and what was the meditation. Like all the
weird sitting stuff.
