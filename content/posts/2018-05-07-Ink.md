[I got this
ink from Tudos for the purpose of reviewing it, free of charge.](https://www.tudos.no/produkt/diamine-30ml-fyllepennblekk/)

I just inked all of my pens in rotation up with this ink. And it behaves
like the other two Diamine inks I have used in the past. It dries a
little bit slower than Iroshizuku inks, but not too bad. And the flow is
a little bit slower than Iroshizuku. But not that bad in the scheme of
things.

This ink has a lovely light blue colour. It kind of reminds me of the
standard blue colour you get with all Pilot fountain opens. But better
than that in all ways. Because like everyone who reads this site knows:

If lighter colours are your thing I would recommend this ink. It is not
something I would buy, because I do in general prefer darker colours.

The Diamine inks are great, they have some very interesting colours, and
is a great option if you are willing to sacrifice a little bit on inflow
and dry time for great colours.
