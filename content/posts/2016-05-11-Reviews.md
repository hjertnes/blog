You will probably find a huge overlap between the products that the different stationary blogs have reviewed. The reason is simple and quite obvious: there are many products that almost everyone has or at least try out because they are fantastic.

Reviews are not an important part of this site. I’m not that into it. It’s not my thing, and I don’t buy that much stuff.
```

But I do write reviews from time to time, either after using them for a while, or what I think about them after using them for a long time.

Are there any value to many different reviews of the same pen, ink or notebook?
```

```text
Yes, there are. And here is why. The reason I think there is a good thing to have as many reviews as possible of the same products is because more information is always a good thing to have before buying it.

For me, the value of a review comes down to three things:
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<ul>

</div>

```text
<li>

  Different people have different opinions

</li>

<li>

  Different Pro and Cons

</li>

<li>

  How a product holds up in a first impression scenario versus after using it for months or years.

</li>
```

<div class="HTML">

</ul>

My process for figuring out if something is for me is a simple process, but it often takes a long time.
```

<div class="HTML">

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<p>

</div>

```text
It always starts out with a product. Before I move on to watching every video review and reading every written review I can find. Before I look at the product details to figure out if it is something for me.
```

```text
I prefer broader and smooth nibs. And I will probably not buy anything with a cartridge-converter filling mechanism because of the compromises the entail.

My pen wish list is very short, because of my very strict guidelines and because I know exactly what I want from a pen. For example my current wish list:
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

  Mont Blanc Meisterstruck

  Visconti Homosapiens

```text
There are two pens that I have been very curious about for a very long time, while at the same time will never end up on my list because I just know that I would be unhappy with them.
```

This is about finding as much information as possible, and to discover what you like and don’t like. It is also about finding out what people that share the same taste as you, while still reading people that don’t, because they might discover something that could tip your decision in either direction.

It is something you learn by experience. There are things about pens that doens’t matter to be, that would drive other people nuts; and the other way around.
