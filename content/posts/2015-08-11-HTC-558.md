This is **bad**.

Okay, I have used finger print scanning technolohy on a few different
devices over the year. And there are two good ways to do it, and a
million bad ways. This is one of the bad ones.

IBM / Lenovo used to(and probably still do) not store a image, but
rather a check sum, to verify the finger print. The good thing about
this technique is that the bad guys can't do anything useful with the
data, if they gain access. The negative is that you need a pretty good
match to unlock your device. And the other thing I liked about their
technology was that you slided you finger over the sensor, and didn't
place it, which means no-one can make a copy of it.

Apple. They simply store the fingerprint on a secure element in phone.
Where you just can compare what you got to what they got. In other
words: your fingerprint isn't in the cloud, in your backups and most
important bad apps can't make a copy.
