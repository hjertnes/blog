I often find myself wanting to set up something simple to solve a very specific problem, but in the past I have often just implemented it as a part of the larger monolithic backend for what ever project it is, because the hassle of setting up a new server and configuring a framework etc would be too much for that simple thing.

But with Docker and Docker Compose I no longer think it is much of a hassle to write what should be a separate service as one. The reason is that you just instal what ever Linux distro you prefer, and run docker-compose up -d and you’re set (if the compose file you used works).

It is also very easy to set up a Express.js project, with CORS, PostgreSQL and Basic Auth. And I also think that it is one of the library / language combos that I have used that is the fastest to develop in.

I have finally gotten around to making my boilerplate sample project available on <a href="https://github.com/hjertnes/sample">GitHub</a>) It is the same thing I based Pompeii, tracker, active users and many other projects (that aren’t open) on.

The time it takes me from going from idea to working is limited to the time you need to get the code working and a machine running docker compose in the cloud; no fiddling around with configuration or complicated frameworks.

To get something up and running both local and on the server with something like Django or .NET Core would probably take ten times as long.
