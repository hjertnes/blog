As anyone who have read this site for a while might guess, I try to keep
things minimal and I try to keep a minimal stash of unused notebooks.

-   Pencils. I buy a significant amount of pencils when I order, but then
    I don't order new ones before I'm about to run out. The reason for
    this is that I have to order from the US to get what I want and it
    isn't a huge difference in shipping if I buy two 12 packs or two 144
    packs.
-   Notebooks: the notebooks I use are available from a Norwegian web site
    so I don't keep a lot of spares. I get three LT1917 Bullet Journals
    when I start the last one, I buy a handfull of Travelers Notebook
    refills when I start the last one, and I buy some packs of Field Notes
    when I have a couple left, and the same goes for DotPads.
-   Ink: I get a new bottle when the current one is almost empty. It is
    too easy to get into a situation with inks where you have more than
    you can expect to use for the rest of your life.
