I have two bags I use a lot. One of them are the big one I
[wrote](/2019/04/18/in-my-bag/) about a few days ago. That is a
Fjellreven Foldstack No. 2 that I bring to work every day. My small bag
is a Foldstack No. 3. I've had it for 4 years or so, and it is the thing
I bring when I want to go light, but still want to bring more stuff than
I can fit in my pockets. That usually means either when I'm hiking with
Luna or going somewhere like to the city or visiting Ingri's parents.

What I typically bring when I hike is:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   My Phone
-   Extra memory cards
-   My water bottle.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

Or when we go somewhere:

-   My X-Pro 2 w/ the 23mm lens
-   The 50mm lens
-   Extra batteries
-   Extra memory cards
-   Phone, wallet, keys, cleaning cloth for my glasses
-   My kindle.
-   A small powerbank.
-   Bellroy Field Notes Case, plus a pencil and my Ystudio fountain pen

The thing I love about this bag is that you can bring a bunch of stuff
with you, but not a lot.
