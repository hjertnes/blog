For various reasons I have moved this site over to WordPress; none of
them are very important in the grand scheme of things. Anyways. I have
been spending quite a lot of time trying to figure out how to best deal
with code in these blog posts. And I have come to the conclusion that
the best compromise between work I have to do, and the best possible
expereince for you as a reader of this site is to embed GitHub Gists.
