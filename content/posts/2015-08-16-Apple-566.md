**Tim Cook:**

> Last year we reported the demographics of our employees for the first
> time externally, although we have long prioritized diversity. We
> promised to improve those numbers and we're happy to report that we
> have made progress. In the past year we hired over 11,000 women
> globally, which is 65 percent more than in the previous year. In the
> United States, we hired more than 2,200 Black employees --- a 50
> percent increase over last year --- and 2,700 Hispanic employees, a 66
> percent increase. In total, this represents the largest group of
> employees we've ever hired from underrepresented groups in a single
> year. Additionally, in the first 6 months of this year, nearly 50
> percent of the people we've hired in the United States are women,
> Black, Hispanic, or Native American.
