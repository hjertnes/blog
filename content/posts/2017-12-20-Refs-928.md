Refs are a way you can do something with your child component. For
example like in the example below:

<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/1577927e0cef8fb6b1a71a67d11e309c>

Like you see in the example, I have made a method on the child component
for changing the background color on the button, and I'd like to call
that from the parent component. The way you do that is to give the
component a ref as a prop. That will add it to the this.refs object, and
give you the ability to call methods on the component. It can be very
useful if you for example have a component with multiple sections of
form values as seperate components and would like to have a Save all
button in the root component.

Refs are useful when you need them, but I personally look at them as a
"last resort". I think that component should be as independent as
possible; the parent should only know that "there are stuff here" and
not too much about the different logic inside children. But again, they
are very useful when you need it.
