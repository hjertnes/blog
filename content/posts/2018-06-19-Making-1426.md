The basic idea behind optimising code is to make what it does today by
doing "less". When you do less, it takes shorter time. That doesn't mean
less code however.

1.  Figure out what takes the most time.
2.  Start at the top and find ways to make it go faster.
3.  Change one thing and test.
4.  Repeat.

Things like writing to disk, output (like printing) or committing write
queries to databases are slow. When I write code I often first focus on
getting it to work, and then I try to make it fast later. One of the
first things I always do is to limit how often I commit transactions to
the database. With complicated background jobs, you can take it from
hours (with large data sets) to minutes if you limit how often you write
to the database. By using transactions. The ideal is once.
