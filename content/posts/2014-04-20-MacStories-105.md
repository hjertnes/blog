[MacStories](http://www.macstories.net) just lauched their "4.0", with
a major and much needed redesign. And I love it.

MacStories is one of the few "high" volume blogs out there that I follow
closely, and read most of their content. The new design is much simpler,
and makes sure the content is in focus. My favourite part of the new
design is that it's finally responsive.

Great work!
