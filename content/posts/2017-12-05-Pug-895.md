[Pug](https://pugsjs.org) is a template language for Javascript that I
have grown to enjoy a lot. My impression is that a lot of people use it,
if they use a templating engine for server side rendering using Node.
The big question is if you need it or not in 2017. I personally believe
that there is a place for it, when you just want to put to gether
something really simple, where the interactivity of a full fledged front
end system like React or Angular would be overkill. But you could
probably make something similar yourself with template literals if your
needs are really simple.

But I personally just go with pug, because the syntax is elegant and
easy to learn. It performs well. And it is really easy to use it with
Express.
