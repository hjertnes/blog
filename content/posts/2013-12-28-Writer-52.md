I have been using Writer Pro, on and off ever since it hit the App
Stores. There are a lot of interesting ideas in it. The design is great,
like it was in iA Writer.

I like the idea of having my documents divided into Notes, Write, Edit
and Read. This is a logical way to organize the documetns. And it makes
it very easy to find stuff.

I have no idea what to say, when it comes to the syntax tools they
provided. It looks cool, and all of that. But I just don't know what I
am suposed to do with them.

And, then you have the list of features I would really love to see. The
Markdown support is like with iA Writer minimal in the iOS version.
There are no highligting, and no markdown button on the extended
keyboard.

There are not any URL schemes included in the app either, this is no
surprice. But it makes the sell for Writer Pro even harder. Drafts is my
starting point for 90% of the writing I do on iOS. And not being able to
use Drafts with Writer Pro is a real game stopper for me. They could
have solved this with a simple url scheme, or by providing Dropbox as an
alternative to iCloud.

I don't think this release are close to as great or eye opening as iA
Writer was. But it is a great set of apps. And it is really sad that
they didn't put the app off for a few more months to include the few
extra features that would have made this app a real Byword competitor
for many of us.
