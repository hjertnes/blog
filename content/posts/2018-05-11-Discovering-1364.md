All software and all other tools as well have pain points.

Pain points are where it isn't as enjoyable to use them. Some of them
can be large or it can be that little tiny thing that gets a little bit
more annoying every time you use it. Starting from not really noticing
them, to driving you completely nuts after days, weeks or months using
it.

They are the kind of thing you don't really notice when you do a regular
review. This is the reason I often write one review of a thing right
after I got it. And then I continue to write about it as I use them
more. One thing I also often do is to rewrite something when I'm about
to stop using it.
