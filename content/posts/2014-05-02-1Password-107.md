Version 4.4 of everyones favourite password management app introduces an
integration with 1Password Watchtower.

I'm so excited about this.

Watchtower is a service maintained by the 1Password team. It's a service
that let you identify all the passwords linked to a website that have
had a security breach since you changed the it.

Everything you need to do to get started is to update the app, enable it
in the preferences. And then a new folder will appear under "Security
Audit".

I know that there are a lot of cheaper apps that makes it possible to
manage passwords. But the reason I stick with 1Password is that it's
more like a whole suite. It gives you the tools to get secure, and stay
secure. You can store passwords, banking info, credit cards, software
keys and secure notes. But the most important part is that version 4 of
the mac came with built in Audit searches. They makes it even easier to
identify and change the password that you need to change. Like old
passwords, weak passwords, duplicates and now Watchtower.

This is without doubt something everyone should enable after the
Heartbleed bug.
