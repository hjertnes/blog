looks like a nice app, and I would have checked it out, if I still was a
[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) user. My go to
note-and-everything-else app for the last year have been
[Evernote](http://evernote.com).

And my go to apps for writing long form on OS X is
[Byword](http://bywordapp.com) and [Sublime
Text](http://sublimetext.com); and I use Byword and
[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) on iOS.
