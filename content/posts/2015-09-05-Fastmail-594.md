**Fastmail:**

> Squire is an HTML5 rich text editor, which provides powerful
> cross-browser normalisation, whilst being supremely lightweight and
> flexible. It is built for the present and the future, and as such does
> not support truly ancient browsers. It should work fine back to around
> Opera 12, Firefox 3.5, Safari 5, Chrome 9 and IE9.
