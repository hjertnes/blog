I was buying some other stuff, and ended up also getting a box of Pearl.
Mainly because it is the one type of blackwings I have not tried.

This is probably my favourite of the regular blackwings from a design
perspective. It looks fantastic. A white finish with gold text.

The core is in the middle between the MMX and 602. It is usable for
writing, but not very.

Unlike the MMX, the Pearl feels like something that you could actually
write with without having to spend more time sharpening than writing.
But still not something I would write a lot with. I still recommend
gettign the 602 for general writing, or one of the limited models with
the extra firm if you can find them.
