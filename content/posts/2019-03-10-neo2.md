I have written about this thing a few times over the half ish year I
have owned it.

The way I use my Alpha Smart Neo2, is that I leave it in the living
room. And when I feel like writing and is not in my office I just turn
it on and start writing.

I just write in file 1 until it's full, then I move over to the next one
and so on. And I try to tranfer stuff into my Mac at least once a week.

My system is that I just place a markdown "h1" and a title, and that
marks a new "document".

I use it for all kinds of stuff, everything from planning to regular
notes and drafts for blog posts. And like I have written about before,
everything that started out on paper first gets transcribed into this
bad boy.

I really like it because it is a thing that does one thing really well,
kind of like my Kindle. I take my Neo if I want to type something out
and I take my Kindle if I want to read.
