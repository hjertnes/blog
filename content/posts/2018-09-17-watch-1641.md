I first go this game on my iPhone, during Christmas, I think. And I
played it some. Then I re-purchased it the day I got my Switch. And this
game is really awesome. The artwork is beautiful, and the game play is a
interesting play on a puzzle game. The main thing is slowing puzzels to
move on, but some stuff are still time sensitive like on a side
scroller.

Awesome game, not that expensive, and I recommend getting it either on
the Switch or on iOS. I prefer the Switch version, but I would not say
that it is better there. I just prefer not having any games on my Phone
