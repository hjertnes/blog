-   Julian Assange is a piece of shit.
-   He has not been convicted of anything except "failure to surrender to
    the court"
-   I have no opinion about what WikiLeaks do today, but I was and still
    am a big supported of what they did back in 2010
-   Extraditation is a legal concept I have a lot of problems with, and is
    just a giant mess.
-   Especially when a country you're not a citizen of or wasn't in when
    the 'crime' occoured.
-   I get that Ecuador had problems with his behaviour, but anyone would
    get crazy by basically being in house arrest for close to 7 years.
