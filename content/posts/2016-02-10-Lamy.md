  Back in 2014, I wrote about the iconic Lamy 2000 fountain pen, and talked about my love for the design and the writing experience of the pen. Well, here we are in 2016 and I’ve expanded my Lamy collection to include a Lamy 2000 rollerball. A lot about the rollerball is the same as the fountain pen version, but this one is obviously a bit more simple since it only has a rollerball cartridge inside. Even though there are a lot of differences between this and the fountain pen, it’s a great pen that would be perfect for a lot of people looking for an elegant, classy, and reliable pen for daily use.

I think this pen is the perfect gift, for when you want to give someone a very nice pen. The other option is to go with a Retro 51. Non fountain pens are weird in this aspect, you can either go for a terrible and fancy pen like a Montblanc, or a good pen, that looks good but isn’t expensive enough: Retro 51. The Lamy 2000 is the only option I know about that looks good, is good to write with and is expensive enough to be appropriate as something like a graduation gift.
