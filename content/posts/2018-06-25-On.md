I have used various other inks brands over the last six months or so. I
don't remember exactly how long. But I have decided to go back to just
using Iroshizuku. The reason is that other inks brands I have tested,
that have as good colours are often worse in some other ways. Like for
example dry time and ink flow.

There are many other interesting colours and inks brands out there. But
I'm perfectly happy with the Iroshizuku colours. And I don't want to
mess around when I could get a worse experience
