  The fact is, this is a good pen, if not a great one. Released to the public in 1950, it has had a 65-plus year run and shows no signs of slowing down. The design is revered too, with its clear hex-barrel being featured in the Museum of Modern Art. A design classic that has stood the test of time? Sign me up.

I have spent many hours writing with stolen Bic Cristal pens over the years. I’m not a fan of this pen, I don’t like how it writes and the ergonomics, but it is without doubt a well designed pen. And I miss the days when this was the standard in all supply cabinets, instead of the horrible pens many of the places I have worked that last five years buy.
