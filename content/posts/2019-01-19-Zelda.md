Zelda Breath of the Wild is a nuts game. It was the first game I got for
my Switch, and it is one of those games I obsess about in certain
periods.

It is a really hard game, and a big game. The thing about Zelda is that
it is a game where you, after the first part, can do shit in more or
less what ever order you want. This means that a lot of it is to figure
out stuff to do.

It is not like Pokemon where you have a order, and a lot of side stuff.
In Zelda there are some orders you have to do stuff, but there are also
a lot of variations to the order you can do the different things.

In order to make stuff a little bit easier on myself I got this huge ass
coffee table book on Zelda.

If you're into Zelda, I'd get it. Both because it is cool, and because
it makes the game easier and less confusing.
