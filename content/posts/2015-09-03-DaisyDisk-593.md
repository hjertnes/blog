Fantastic update, to a fantastic piece of software. I love daisy disk. I
have used many different apps that show you the stuff that steals your
disk space, but none of them do it like Daisy Disk. It looks good, and
makes both easy and a joy to free up some space.

It is a must for everyone with a SSD mac.
