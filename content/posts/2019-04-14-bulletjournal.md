For as long as I have been using notebooks for managing my life, close
to ten years by now, I have used Patrick Rhone's
[Dashplus](https://patrickrhone.com/dashplus/) during most of that. It
does more or less the same as the bullet journal notation. I have
decided that I'm going to do my Bullet Journaling with Dash/plus instead
of the standard notation. I changed this a couple of months ago. Why? No
particular reason, they are very similar and there are no advatages to
one over the other. But there is one huge advantage to dash/plus for me,
I have used it for so long that it would take me a really long time to
unlearn it. p
