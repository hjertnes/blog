**Federico Viticci:**

> Version 1.1 of Workflow includes over 50 new actions and dozens of
> fixes, improvements, and changes to existing actions. Core parts of
> the app have been revised for a faster experience and the foundation
> laid with the Content Graph has started to pay off with the addition
> of metadata and filters. Because I've been playing around with
> Workflow 1.1 since the app's original release two months ago, I'm
> going to offer some practical examples with a high-level overview of
> the changes.
