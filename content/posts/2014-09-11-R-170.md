I rarely write about anything news related here. My usual reasoning for
this is that I don't have the time, a lot of other people do it way
better than me. But the most important reason is that I'm not interested
in it.

This is one of the few exceptions. My goal is to write about it, when I
get the feeling "I have to write about this".

The fact that Jason Snell is leaving Macworld, and the fact that the
Macworld magazine are shutting down is mind boggling.

You have publications like The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker or
The New York Times; they have always been there; and I hope they will
continue to be there, well beyond my death. I have always looked at PC
World, and Macworld as the two publications that always was there. And
it is sad to se that both of them are gone in a few months.

The print version of PC World was shut down a while ago, and now
Macworld.

It is sad. But most of all weird.

A lot of great writers lost their job, and we lost our number one
Mac-site.
