**Peter Cohen:**

> Iwata was remarkable for a few reasons. He was the first boss of
> Nintendo who was not a member of the founding Yamauchi family. He was
> also only the fourth person to run the company, which got its start in
> the 19th century as a maker of hanafuda playing cards. Iwata was also
> not a career executive: He started out as a programmer, working for a
> Japanese video game developer called HAL Laboratory Inc.Â 

The world lost a giant.
