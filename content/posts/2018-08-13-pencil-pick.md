I have tried quite a few pencils over the last few months. And I thought
it was time to kind of pick one that could be my daily driver. The
pencils that I was considering were:

1.  Blackwing 602
2.  Field Notes Pencil
3.  Golden Bear.

What I was looking for was a pencil that felt like a quality product,
with a point that didn't go dull very fast, while at the same time
wasn't too scratchy. Price, design and how comfortable it was to write
was also factors I considered.

Each of these pencils have something about them that would make them a
fantastic pick. The Field Notes pencil are so comfortable to write with.
It is awesome. While the 602 has a very smooth led. While the Golden
Bear has a fantastic led that keeps the point better than the 602, while
being smother than the Field Notes pencil. But it isn't as comfortable
to write with compared to either one of them.

I decided to with the Golden Bear for a number of reasons. The main
thing was price. Let me compare: A pack of 12 Blackwings are $22 the
last time I checked, and a 144 pack of Golden Bears are $30. The 602 is
better than the Golden Bear, but it is not that much better.

Both the Field Notes pencil and the 602 are better than the Golden Bear,
but also more expensive. And the Golden Bear is also a good compromise
between the two in many aspects.

Anyways. The Golden Bear is a awesome cheap pencil that I use every
single day.
