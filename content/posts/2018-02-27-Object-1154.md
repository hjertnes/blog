This one is awesome.

Let's say you have a object, and you want to loop over the keys and
values of it. There is a new method on the Object prototype for this.
Just run Object.entries and you'll get a list of list

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/c65db279192844fde721ff07a84f9902.js>"></script>

</div>

I wonder how much code could be removed with all the recent additions to
the Object prototype?
