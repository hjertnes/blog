One very cumbersome operation in Javascript in the past, was the process
of combining multiple objects. For example taking the output of multiple
methods, combining them, before passing them on. There have been some
good and some horrible and some less horrible ways to do this in the
past. I used to either do it manually or to looping over objects, which
wasn't the most convenient thing in the world before 'for in'. This is
very easy to do with Object.assign.

```text
The way it works is that you can give it any number of objects as arguments, and it combines it into a single object. And if a key exist in multiple of the inputs it will use the <strong>latest</strong>. As you can see in the example above. </div>
