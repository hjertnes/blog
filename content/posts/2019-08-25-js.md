There are some problems with JavaScript. For example how broken math is or how much it pretends to be a C# or Java like OOP language.

But JavaScript is in general great. We get a new version of the language every year, that solves real problems. And there are new tools and libraries showing up each month (sometimes each week) that try to solve a problems a lot of people have. The great thing about this is that what is a real pain point in 2018 is very different from 2019.

This isn't all without issues however. The negative side to thing becoming a little bit better more or less all the time is that you as a developer will have to spend more time keeping up to date than you would in a slower moving community.

But I'm in general mostly happy with where JavaScript and Node have been moving.
