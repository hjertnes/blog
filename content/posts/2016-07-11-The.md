I have used the MTN for over six months now, and I have tried countless numbers of different configurations of refills in it. I currently have two refills in it. One for journaling, and one for tasks. But, I also have two refills bundled together with one of the MTN rubber bands for my “work” notebooks; one lined for tasks, and one blank for everything else.

Yes, I’m going to buy another one, or find a better solution.

The number of refills comes down to a number of different factors. But one above everything else is the writing comfort. The most practical from a writing standpoint is to use it with two refills, while the most practical from a “have as much options as possible” is to fill it up with six refills.

From a day to day usage stand point, I think two refills is the ideal, even though three is workable, if you need to. The problem with too many refills is that everything moves around every time you are trying to do something, and it is hard to fill the pages.

I wish the MTN worked better with a lot of refills, but it doesn’t. I still think it is a fantastic system, but you need to pick your poison, many refills and many MTN covers, or fewer refills.
