I have my [wiki](https://wiki.hjertnes.blog) and I have this site. One thing I will do in 2020 is to go through everything on my site and delete everything I don't want to have on it anymore. And I will move everything that have some "evergreen" quality to it to my wiki.

A thing I want my wiki to become is this huge combination of stuff connected together by tabs.
