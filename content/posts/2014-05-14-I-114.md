One of the first things I started looking into when I got my first iPad
was how I could use it as my primary computer.

A lot of stuff have happened since that. My primary Mac have moved from
a 15” Macbook Pro, to a 13” Macbook Air. And I have three generations of
iPad keyboard laying around here; in the same pile as my iPad 2.

Here is the thing, my Macbook Air have more or less the same battery
life as an iPad. And the power of OS X and the more or less same weight
makes my Macbook Air the perfect iPad.

But. I might consider buying a iPad mini. Yeah, I know; I have been
talking about that since Apple released the first iPad mini.

The iPad Air is too close to a Macbook Air; and OS X have so much power
compared to iOS. And I don't need another iPad collecting dust. While an
iPad mini would provide some value for me. It looks like a great
computer to do some writing on, in the context where I might do some
writing, but I don't wanna wring a bag.

The iPad sales are going down, and some people are saying that the iPad
is dead. I don't believe that. Our current Macbook Air's and iPad's are
too close to each other. And I think -- and hope that iOS 8 will bring
something to the table that gives us something that we couldn't do with
a mac.

A reason to buy an iPad Air or iPad mini instead of a Mac.
