DaisyDisk is a great tool, for exactly one job: to figure out where all
your disk space have gone.

I first heard about it on [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu) a very
long time ago. And I have used it ever since. It used to be the kind of
tool I only needed because of software development. But I think everyone
should have it today.

The reason is very simple. Most of us have SSD drives today. And that
means: less space. I went from 1TB to 256GB. I used to operate with a
buffer that was the same as the available space on my current drive.

Don't buy daisy disk today, but wait for the next time you think: where
did all my hard drive space go?
