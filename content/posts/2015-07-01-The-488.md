Tools and Toys are reviewing my favourite pen -- the Lamy 2000. I got
the pen around seven months ago, and I love it. I have considered to buy
another good fountain pen, but I never pull the trigger, because I'm so
happy with it.

-   It looks fantastic. It has the unique look that I always love in
    products, everyone that have seen a Lamy 2000 once, can reconize it.

-   The writing preformance is amazing. I have never used a pen with
    better writing experience, and I use it when I can, everything from in
    Field Notes to lecture notes, blog drafts and in my journal.

-   Piston filler. The pen uses a piston filler, instead of cartridges,
    which sounds more messy than it is. It is pretty clean. The good thing
    about it is that it is way cheaper than buying a bottle of ink than
    cartridges long term, and filling the Lamy 2000 is less messy than
    filling a converter.
