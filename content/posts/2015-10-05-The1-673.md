I agree, this is one of the best new things in El Cap. I have a lot of
things going on in the Menu bar, and that is great when you need it, but
I also find everything that isn't related to what I'm doing a
distraction, and the only way you could hide the menu bar in previous
versions of OS X was to go into Full Screen mode. I think Full screen
mode is great, but it isn't always the right choice.

It is great to finally be able to auto hide it.
