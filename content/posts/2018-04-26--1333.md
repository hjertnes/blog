Every time I read some article or book about some new and amazing
software development methodology or office / no office work system I
pick up on some useful information. But the thing about all of them are
that what works for your team or company depends on what you and the
people you work with.

For some teams it wouldn't matter if they were located in the same area
or not, because they only talk over Slack. While others have too much
"meat space" collaboration for it to work. Some people think working for
home is the best. While others can't deal with it. The perfect for me
would be to do it like half of the time.

The same goes for agile. I know developers that can design and build
features themselves and developers that can't do anything unless someone
give them drawing and descriptions of everything.

Pick up on the details you and your co workers like and build the mix
that work for you. And hey you might get a book deal and write the next
book I get annoyed at.
