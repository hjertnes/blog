This was the second pencil that I have used since I got into them.

You can purchase these German Pencils more or less everywhere that sells
books or stationary here in Norway.

This is very good writing pencil. The point lasts forever and is very
comfortable to use. I also love the fact that it doesn't have any of
those silly erasers on top. This will without a doubt be the pencil I
buy when I just need a pencil when I'm in town.

What I don't like about it however is how cheap it feels. The casing
feels very cheap, I think it is too light and the finish starts to chop
off or fade before you get home. But I think that this would be a
awesome pencils if it came in a nicer casing.
