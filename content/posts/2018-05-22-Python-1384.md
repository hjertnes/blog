Python is solid language, with a lot of good libraries, framework and a
lot of _great_ documentation. This makes it an obvious choice for a
number of things, everything from command line programs to Web
Development because of stuff like Flask, Django and Jinja.

But there are a number of problems with the language that makes it a
poor fit for larger things, even with the addition of type hints.
Because Python is a language where developer productivity is very
important. But you have almost no validation of the code before loading
it into the runtime. Like types and pre flight checks. This means that
you need to write way more unit and integration tests than you would
with a typed language.

I'm probably going to continue with Python for some stuff, because it is
so easy. But I'm not going to write any work stuff in it. Because of
types, and because Python almost makes it a priority to make sure it is
impossible to follow functional programming concepts.

The reason I often go with Django for a little bit larger stuff at home
is that it is so easy to put together some models, add unit testing to
them and get something that works. And flask is perfect for some small
api's. But I think Clojure is the future for my Projects.
