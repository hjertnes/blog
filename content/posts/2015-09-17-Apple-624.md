Great. It is nice to see that Apple finally have changed their prices
for cloud storage, for the better. Their old prices was so ridiculously
overpriced that it wasn't even a little bit funny. The new prices are
good, and comparable to the rest of the industry. My only complaint is
that the free tire should be larger.
