Okay. So I don't understand this one. But I have seen countless interns
and other people try this really fucking dumb this. So I guess I have to
say it: write the following a 1000 times on a white board

I WILL NOT MIRROR PROPS TO STATE UNLESS I HAVE A REALLY FUCKING GOOD
REASON FOR DOING SO.

What I see them doing is that they send a:1, b:2, c:3 as props and then
they set it as state. Before rendering it from state. Why? I have no
idea. The result is that you'll get an extra render for every time props
change and a bunch of extra code.

The only situation where I see that it might be needed is if you recieve
some data via props that you're going to change in form.
