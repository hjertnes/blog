The two pens I own that I use more than anything else are my Lamy 2000 and my TWSBI 580AL.

My 580 is always in my MTN pen holder because it has a screw on cap, never leaks and is the perfect pen for writing a little bit here and there. But still perfectly acceptable to write long form on the go, if I need to.

The Lamy 2000 is a different story. It isn’t the perfect when it comes leaks, and hasn’t a screw on cap. But it is my favourite pen to write with; especially when I sit down to really write for longer periods of time, like I am doing now. The nib is wet and very smooth, and the lack of threading for a screw on cap makes the whole grip section much more comfortable to hold for longer periods.

I’m not that interesting in finding the perfect pen for everything, because that would be almost impossible.

```text
I want the best possible pen to have in my bag, to use both at work and on the go. The most important thing for when it comes to this pen is that the nib is smooth, it never leaks any ink, cap or anywhere else and that it has a screw on cap. This is in many aspects the opposite of what I want from the perfect long form writing pen. I don’t care that much if it leaks a little bit into the cap, and I don’t want a screw on cap, because being comfortable to use it for a long time is much more important.

I don’t have any complaints about my Lamy 2000, it does exactly what I want it to do.

My 580 is different story. While I don’t have much to complain about, I still don’t think it is the perfect. The next pen I am going to buy is intended to replace its role. This will be a Pilot Custom Heritage 92. I don’t want one tools that can make a good job everywhere, I want a set of tools that can make an awesome job where they fit.
