Like I mentioned in a earlier post, I have limited the number of pens I
use to three. My Lamy 2000, Pilot Vanishing Point and my Pilot Metal
Falcon. The way I rotate them is that I always use the pen that is all
the way to the right in my Nock.co Hightower. And when I write it dry, I
refill it, and rotate everything to the right and the pen I wrote dry in
the left pocket.
