Soulver have become one of my all time favourite apps. I use it for
almost everything related to numbers, on iOS and OS X. I think I first
heard about it from [Marco](http://marco.org). I think he mentioned it
on the episode of MacPowerUsers he was on, and various times on Build
and Analyse1.

Soulver is in many ways what spreadsheets should be. It lets you work
with numbers and related operations in text. I use it for all kinds of
different things. I store close to everything in my PlainText folder.
Everything from keeping track of how many hours I have spent on the
different jobs I have, to everything else I need to remember. The great
thing about Soulver is that I can just paste a file in the current
format

The big issue with this system is how to calculate the total. I could do
it by hand, but it might be 10 rows, or 100. So I just paste the content
into Soulver and it tells me what the total is. It's great.

information about Soulver. And all the cool stuff it can do.
