Fantastic post about personal journaling.

It is a struggle to journal. I do it more or less every day, but it
started out as something I did once a month, then once a week, before I
slowly turned it into a daily thing. And I also write more important
essays and "stories" in my journal first, some of them might show up
here, as some point, while others don't.

My advice about journaling: first you need to really wanting to do it,
then you need to force yourself into the habit; and don't start with
doing it daily; weekly is enough; and then take a
[NAJOWRIMO](http://nanowrimo.org) challenge.
