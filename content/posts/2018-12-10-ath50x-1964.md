I have many different headphones over the years. My go to at home or
when I am on the go is the Apple AirPods because the design and
Bluetooth implementation makes it the perfect take it on a listen
without too much fuss thing I have seen.

But what I want at work is very different.

I want it to be comfortable, be good at shuting out the world and good
sound. Wireless was not a requirement because I will be using it on my
work laptop most of the time. And I did not want to spend A LOT of money
on this.

So I went to the Marco.org big ass review and looked over his main
picks. And I went for the 50x because none of the negatives were that
important to me. And it was a lot cheaper than the others.

They did come out with a bluetooth version like the week after I got
mine. But I don't care, because I will not use it much if at all with my
phone no matter what.

I'm very happy with them. They don't look pretty, but they sound
fantastic are comfortable to wear hour after hour and shut out all the
people I share an office with when I need that.
