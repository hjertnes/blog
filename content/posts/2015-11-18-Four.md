  <strong><a href="http://www.penaddict.com">The Pen Addict</a></strong>. I have been reading The Pen Addict for a long time; I found it when I started to listen to the <a href="http://relay.fm/penaddict">podcast</a> with the same name. It is a fantastic resource, and I always check up what Brad(or any of the the other contributors) have written about it before buying a new notebook or pen.

  <strong><a href="http://www.thecramped.com">The Cramped</a></strong> is another fantastic pen & paper blog by Patrick Rhone. Mr. Rhone is one of, if not my favourite web personality. The thing I love about The Cramped is that it isn’t about reviews and the new hot notebook or pen, it is about how stuff are used.

  <strong><a href="http://www.wellappointeddesk.com">The Well Appointed Desk</a></strong> is the blog of Ana a.k.a “The third host of The Pen Addict Podcast”. It is a fantastic blog, and the thing I love about it is all the great links I find there.

  <strong><a href="http://www.thefinerpoint.net/">The Finer Point</a></strong> is the newest pen blog I subscribe to. I think it is very good, interesting reviews, even though most of the stuff isn’t new, but I always value another point of view before buying something; especially if it is expensive.
