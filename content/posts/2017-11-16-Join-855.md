Join is a method living on the String prototype. All it does is to take
a list of strings and combines them into a string, either with or
without a dividing character. Very useful if you have a array of
something that you want to list out seperated by a comma or something
like that. Below is an example, both with Join and I also re-implemented
join as a reducer, just because they are so similar; but reduce is far
more powerful.
