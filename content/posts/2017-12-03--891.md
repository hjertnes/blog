When I observe people discuss Net Neutrality I think back on the most
important skill I got out of my philosophy degree. And that is to look
for an understanding of all the different sides and to identify the
different layers of opinion.

In this case you have those who think NN is a good idea, and you have
those who don't. And for those who think NN is the way to go you have
different opinions regarding how to do it. Some think Title 2 is the
best option, while others think that approach is a little bit too heavy
handed.

I don't have any particular opinions on how we get there. But I think
that there shouldn't be any differences. All traffic is treated equal.
And ideally no transfer cap. You pay for a certain speed, and that's it.

One of those typical "deals" I see from certain carriers that really
annoy me is that "Spotify or Netflix doesn't count against your data
cap".

It is a bad idea to have it if it is only limited to one service for
music and one for movies. But would it be a problem if it was all music
and movie streaming? As long as it was easy enough to be approved as
either.
