All the components you have seen up this point, in this blog post
series, have been of the regular React type; either based on Component
or PureComponent. There are two others.

One of them are the "old-school" React.createClass, which is now
deprecated. This is how React Component were defined before the "class"
keyword in Javascript. It does more or less the same as if you use the
class based component, only that the syntax is a little bit more
"weird".

The last kind is stateless functional components. They look like this:

The functional components are useful; and a highly controversial topic
among some. The easiest way to understand them is to think of them as a
component only being the render method. It will re-render every time the
props change. And they don't have any life cycle or state. I think they
are useful for a number of reasons

You really consider if you component <span class="underline">need</span> state. If so, it would require a re-write.
```
