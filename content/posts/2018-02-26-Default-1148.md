One of the first "you don't support what??" moments with me and
JavaScript was when I discovered that default parameters weren't
supported. We have managed just fine without them, but they care nice to
have. And can save you a lot of work at times.

They are finally supported now.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/7feae7e37f44d4007baf4378fd700b54.js>"></script>

</div>

If you only come from JavaScript, the basic idea is that you give the
parameters you want to be optional a default parameter. Like in the
example above.
