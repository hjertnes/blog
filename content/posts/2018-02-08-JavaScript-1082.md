Two of the most popular editors for web developers these days are Atom
and Visual Studio Code.

Both of them are developed using JavaScript and Electron. Both are great
for web development and especially JavaScript. They are very similar,
but still very different. I personally greatly prefer Visual Studio Code
over Atom because of the fundamental differences.

Atom is a very flexible editor, you can use it as a basis to build
entire IDE, like Facebook have done for their React Native IDE. To put
flexibility before speed can give you some interesting results. Visual
Studio Code on the other hand have a rich and flexible extension echo
system, but it is far from as flexible.

I personally think VS Code is better. It is much faster. And I have zero
tolerance for editors that are slow.

Pick your poison.
