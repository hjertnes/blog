There aren't many things I'm worse at than keeping up with anniversaries
and stuff like that. Part of the reason is that I write most of the post
from a few weeks to a few months before they are going live, so I have
little to no connection to when something will be live. That has the
added benefit of me doing everything I can to make them have as little
connection to "right now" as possible.

By the time this goes live I would have written this blog for over two
years. A lot have happened over that time. These days I'm more or less
happy with the kind of stuff I'm using. And the main area of
experimenting is new inks. I might try a couple of new notebooks a year,
and I only get new pens when I see something I don't have in some pen I
discover.

I guess I have moved over to what I really wanted this site to be about.
Writing more about using the products, than the products themselves. And
how to go about figuring out the perfect stuff for me. Rather than
reviewing all the Lamy Safari or TWSBI colors.

What if I actually manages to schedule this post for the real
anniversary next year?
