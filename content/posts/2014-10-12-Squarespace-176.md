The last time I posted about this, was a few hours after Squarespace
announced version 7. I haven't had the opportunity to test it, at all,
then. But I have been playing with it for a few hours -- over a few days
now. And I love it.

Squarespace 6 was one huge, and impressive update. But the admin
interface was always a little bit too weird and messy for my taste.

They are fixing it in version 7. It's in beta right now.

**This is what I love about version 7 this far:**

-   The new menu system in the admin interface is simpler, cleaner, makes
    more sense and is easier to navigate.

    <div class="HTML">
      <div></div>

    </p>

    </div>

-   You don't have to leave the admin interface to work with the site
    layout.

**This is what I don't like:**

-   I can't edit or write blog post in full screen. This was possible
    before LayoutEngine 2.

Squarespace 7 is not the same kind of update that 6 was. But this is the
kind of update that every Squarespace user will love. Not a huge amount
of new stuff. But a lot of improvements, that some of us have been
asking for, for a very long time.
