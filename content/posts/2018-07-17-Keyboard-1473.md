I do not know how many times I have downloaded and done a trial of
Keyboard Maestro without "getting into it".

Keyboard Maestro is a power tool that this blog post wont fully cover.
But think of it as a tool to do various stuff on a given event. That can
be a keyboard trigger, you connect to wifi or that you click "run this
macro". What you do can be all different kinds of stuff, you should take
a look at it to get a proper overview. But the stuff I currently use it
for is when I want to override default app shortcuts by running Apple
Script that does kind of the same thing, but not entirely. Or my work
around for the lack of proper batch operations in Lightroom CC. The
short version is that I want to "Auto tune" a large collection of
images. Typically after I import something etc. The way you have to do
this is to open a image, click the button, move one to the right and
then repeat. I made a keyboard maestro macro that loops over it a pre
defined number of times.

It still takes a long time, but it frees me to drink coffee or beer
while watching my MacBook slaving away.

This is the tool you want if you want to do some really geeky shit on
your Mac.
