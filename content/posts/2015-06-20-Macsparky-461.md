David Sparks, on Gruber's Interview with Phil Schiller:

> One part of the interview that stood out for me started at 57:22. I
> was pretty close to the stage at this point and Phil explained, "I'm
> in my job for one reason. Because I'm a customer like you." Reading
> these words, I'm sure you are thinking that this is just a marketing
> guy being the "marketing guy". However, you would be wrong. Go listen
> to the recording. I was watching him as he stated these words and they
> were completely genuine.
