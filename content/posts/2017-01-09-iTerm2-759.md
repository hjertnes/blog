Mac OS X comes with a built in Terminal. It is very good, one of the better ones I have used in fact. But I have used another app called iTerm2 for years. I also used to use an app called iTerm back in the day.

The reason I started using iTerm1 back in the day, and then iTerm2, and the reason I use them today is a little bit different. Or to be a little bit less confusing, the main reason is different, but most of the points remain the same.

```text
The reason I switched back, in 2008 or something. I don’t remember, it was probably right after I got my first Mac. It was the first version of the white Intel MacBook, was because I preferred the out of the box look and feel of iTerm over Terminal.app. And that remains the same with iTerm2 today. I try to always pick the alternative that makes me happy with no or as close to no configuration as possible.

In other words: iTerm2 looks better out of the box than Terminal.app.

But the main reason I use iTerm2 today is the superior window management: splitting and tabs. Terminal.app supports both, but I think both works better in iTerm2. Let me clarify something before we start, I use a lot of terminals. This means a lot of tabs, a lot of terminals grouped together in a tab and so on.

```text
The main problem with Terminal.app’s tab management is the position of the tab-bar. Having them horizontal at the top of the window do look the best, but when you have al to of tabs, I think having them vertical on either left or right side is the most practical, both to fit more tabs and to see which is which.

```text
Having multiple windows are great, and because of how difficult window management on OS X and other operating systems are, I prefer to have one terminal window, with multiple tabs, where I can split that tab vertically and horizontally. For example, a development web server running on one screen, database console one half of the other side, and a general purpose terminal on the rest of the the second half. It makes it easy to find the terminals I am looking for and so on. This is not possible with the built in Terminal.app. You can only split horizontally. One way to solve this is to use tmux or screen; they are both great, but very overkill when I only need to do two things, and much harder to use than the built in functionality on iTerm2.
