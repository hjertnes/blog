I got this sharpener last summer, and I have used it close to a year now, and I do love it:

-   It has a cool and vintage look
-   It makes a perfect point every single time; that isn't so sharp that it breaks too easy.
-   It sharpens pencils really fast.

But it isn't perfect:

-   It leaves some tiny marks on the pencil
-   It's noisy.
-   And it almost always leaves some pencils shavings where I use it

The marks on the pencil bothers me a little, but not that much to be honest. And I do think all the bad isn't close to being even to all the great things about this sharpener. Seriosly. It would take me less than 5 minutes to sharp the both sides of a 12 pencils.
