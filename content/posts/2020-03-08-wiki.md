Not a lot of new stuff this week, but I have worked on some stuff this week.

-   The org file my wiki was generated from is now included, will soon add a link to it and the github project
-   A links section. The idea is to add links I use all the time to this one
-   A Journal section. The idea is to add some limited in scope or time "blog like" series of texts here. Currently only one on how I think about making this wiki
-   Added a "last updated" timestamp to everything. Set to today.
-   Updated my comics list
-   Some small re-org of the emacs section
