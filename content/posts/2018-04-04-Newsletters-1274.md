I have multiple times in my life made a real effort to limit the amount
of e-mail I receive. And I have tried all kinds of different approaches
to how to limit it. For example spending hours subscribing for
everything in one go. And I have scheduled a slow each day or week to
remove one of a few.

The most efficient approach for me is to sit down once a week and remove
ten. I just search for "unsubscribe" and remove ten. And then I do the
same next week. The reason I think this approach is good is because then
you identify those who have sent you emails recently. And you also have
the choice of keeping the newsletter you enjoy.

I only mark emails as spam and blacklist them after making a real effort
to get rid of them.
