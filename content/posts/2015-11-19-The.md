  Retro 51 — the darling of rollerballs — recently celebrated an important milestone of making great pens for 25 years. I had no idea that my favorite rollerball pen maker was having such a significant anniversary this year, but it’s certainly exciting.

That is one good looking pen. I love my Retro 51, and there are so many fantastic designs. I think it is too bad that I don’t need a rollerball more often, because I don’t need more than one pen I barley use. This is the Retro 51 I would have bought if I was ordering one today.
