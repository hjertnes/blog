E-mail is crap. Sorry, but I had to say it. I have tried it all, There
would be at least two home screens full of e-mail apps on both my iPhone
and iPad if I installed them all. And I would spend a fortune if I had
an active subscription to all of the cool and interesting e-mail hosting
and related services that I have tested.

My current setup is quite simple. I host my email account at
[FastMail.fm](http://FastMail.fm) and I use
[MailRoute](http://mailroute.net) for spam filtering. And I use the
standard Apple Mail.app applications on both iPad and Mac.

I don't use the because they are the best, but because they are good
enough. I found out something interesting when I moved from a few a bit
prettier and fancier apps to then stock ones, last year. And that was
that I spend far less time, "doing e-mail", if I used worse apps.

You need to find out what works for you.
