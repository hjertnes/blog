I've been shooting with both my x100t and my X-Pro 2 today. I prefer the
X-Pro 2 in almost every way. Don't get me wrong the x100 is awesome. But
I prefer some of the more advanced features of the X-Pro 2. And, while I
appreciate how quiet the leaf shutter of the x100 is, I prefer the clunk
of regular one.

I need to get me one of those 23mm f2 lenses though, because while I
prefer the 35 most of the time, the 23 is awesome when you are very
close on what you want to shoot. A 50 is good when you want to chose
what to include, while a 35 is awesome when you just want as much as
possible of it, without it being too much.
