I was looking at new stuff coming in ES7 and ES8; you know, stuff that
weirdos like me do. And I came over a very cool pair: padStart and
padEnd. You can run it on any string and it will pad the end or the
start with a string x times. It works like this:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/a209bb0e55ca529c3428dba2ab02ef54.js>"></script>

</div>

Looks like a great option when you just want to add X of something
either before or after a string.
