I have written about use-package before, but I'm going to try again
because I don't think I got my point across.

Use-package is a emacs package that cotnains a macro called use-package,
it makes it easy to deal with packages in a clean manner. n

If you take my typical emacs setup before emacs I had this long list of
packages, that I looped over and checked if they were installed, if not
I installed them. Then all of it was loaded and configured in a very
speicifc manner to make sure it all worked. Use-package solves all of
this.

The way it works is that it have a lot of different keywords that you
can usem and the result is that you can avoid all kinds of nesting and
weird issues, and just write the config in a way it makes sense to you.
The reason I got started with it was because of the :ensure keyword,
because that enabled me to install and load in one step.

Here is the documentation:
<https://jwiegley.github.io/use-package/keywords/>. The way I have gone
deeper and deeper into it is by starting simple and using new stuff as I
see a place for it.
