For of is one of a few recent additions to the for loop in Javascript.
It makes it possible to do what is basically a foreach in most other
programming languages, like for example C#. for(var item of array){} is
more or less the same as foreach(var item in array){} in C#. Why not
just use .map or .forEach? Well, I usually do, but to do that can be a
little bit cumbersome when you are dealing with async methods and async
await, because then the arrow function in the .map also needs to be
async etc. And it is nice to have an fast way to just loop through an
array without having use a old school for loops. They are useful
sometimes, and you should know how they work, but it is nice to have a
quick and easy way to just loop thorugh an array.
