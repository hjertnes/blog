  The Clairefontaine Basics Life Unplugged notebook is my new favorite notebook. The simple design and wonderful paper, along with the great price of just $9, make this notebook an irresistible tool in my arsenal. If you don’t mind being locked in to a lined-only paper, you owe it to yourself to give Clairefontaine a shot. Who knows — it might be your new favorite paper.

That looks like a fantastic notebook. Some people dislike lined paper, and I feel the same way from time to time. But lined paper is great for making lists and writing because you waste much less paper when you have lines; or even a grid system if you prefer something a little bit more flexible.
