Goulet posted about something very interesting a few days ago:<a href="http://blog.gouletpens.com/2016/02/midori-travelers-notebook-rebranding.html?m=1">Midori Traveler’s Notebook Rebranding!</a>. I love my MTN. And I am very excited about the news. The new colour looks amazing.

I’m a huge fan of the regular sized notebook. And the passport isn’t really something I’m interested in, for a number of reasons, that I’m coming back to in a upcoming post. But they are finally making sure that all the great refills you can get are the same for both options. Which makes the passport sized one much more attractive.
