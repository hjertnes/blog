I don't think it's a huge secret that I'm not the biggest fan of the
current incarnation of the MacBook Pro. But there are also stuff I love
about it.

Let's begin with what I don't like:

-   Keyboard. I don't care if they make the kind of keyboard I prefer. But
    I do want a keyboard I know will work reliably all the time. All my
    MacBooks up until this one have given me that. Apple got to either fix
    their current keyboard, or go back to the old one and make sure that
    they are reliable.

-   SD slot. This is not a must. But my life and the life of everyone that
    owns some kind of camera would be better if it was built into the
    machine.

What I like:

-   USB-C. I love that thing. I can use the same brick to charge my iPhone
    and my Mac. And I can also get power over the same cable I use to
    connect an external screen to my Mac. (I use the LG 27â€³ USB-C screen;
    I have one at home and one at the office).

-   Screen. It's awesome.

-   Function key row versus Touch Bar. This should not be a separate
    model, but rather an option.
