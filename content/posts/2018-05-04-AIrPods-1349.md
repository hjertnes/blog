I write this around 24 hours after I got them.

The AirPods are the perfect Apple Product. You just unpack them open the
lid next to your iPhone, tap connect and put them in and start listening
to Motorhead. They sound great, don't fall out of your ears and just
work. Some in ear plugs are not comfortable to use hours after hours,
these are. They also strike the perfect balance in many ways, the
battery life are not the best, but you just stick them in the case for a
while and you have more battery life.

There are some stuff I don't like about them though. It seems like the
case will get really dirty very fast. And I wish it was easier to see
the battery status of everything on my iPhone.

And I want to buy the person who came up with "AirPods" and "EarPods" a
beer.
