I sometimes write about both my thoughts, and problems about making
money on apps, podcasts and websites. This might be odd to some people.
But the reason is quite simple. I have a website, while I don't have any
podcasts or paid apps. I might get into them at some point. But I would
love to be able to make money on my site at some point.

But the real reason I care is that I love the work indies and small
companies are doing. For example app companies like
[Tapbots](http://tapbots.com) and [Agile
Tortoise](http://agiletortoise.com); podcast networks like [5by5](http://5by5.tv) and
[Relay](http://relay.fm); or writers like
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) and
[Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com). Just to mention a few.

They all provide something large companies or media houses can't. Small
podcast network or indie podcasters test and do the stuff the large
corporations can't. Small app developers do all kinds of great and
interesting things, that large companies can't; and they can afford to
make delightful apps, that target a small audience. While indie writers
can do the kind of writing that I love to read; it's not generic
writing; it's personal, something large websites can't.

We need both small and large; but we need to figure out how to make both
parts of the business sustainable.
