The spring semester is starting tomorrow. Which made me think, should I
try to see for how long I can cope with just using my iPad, notebook and
iPhone outside my flat. I have tried this in various contexts and with
varying degree of success is the past.

There are a few reasons for trying this out. For one, I always tell
people that they should just get an iPad instead of a laptop. And I hate
to get the question "Why don't you do it?". The two other, and better
reasons for doing it is that my iPad takes up far less space in my bag,
which means I can bring more books. And the last and most important
reason is focus. There are far less things and distractions going on
when I write in either Editorial or Notesy on my iPad, than when I use
my mac.

I will not go into one of those silly "One month without my Mac" or
similar cheesy games. But I wont bring my Macbook Air with my anywhere,
before I need to do something outside of my flat that is far less
efficient on iOS.

Lets see how it goes!
