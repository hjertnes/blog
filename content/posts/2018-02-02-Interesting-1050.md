I'm not interested in most of the languages that compile to JavaScript.
Some of them add syntax sugar (CoffeeScript), while others are too
removed from the community (Elm) and others aren't I that sure about
(TypeScript).

The reason I don't like CoffeeScript is that I don't see anything but a
different syntax to write JavaScript. In other words there are no
technical reasons to use it as far as I can see. While Elm is it's own
eco system, and why would I choose to not use the community around NPM?
The best of the three is without doubt TypeScript, but I'm not sure if
writing C# for JavaScript is the way to go, yet.

Then I discovered [Reason)(<https://reasonml.github.io/>). It looks like
it has a lot of what I dig about Elm (Type Safety aka discovering a
majority of the potential bugs at build time) while still being able to
use existing modules from NPM; and using stuff from the OCaml eco system
is a great bonus.

It looks great, and I'm going to check this out in the near future. â‰ˆ
