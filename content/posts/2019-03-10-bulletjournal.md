So, I have modified some stuff about my Bullet Journal setup after about
a month.

In the beginning I started to allocate a lot of pages to sections that I
knew would change a lot. Like my future log and daily log. I still
allocate some pages to it, but instead of being 10 I usually don't give
it more than four. And I have ditched the Index, because I never even
looked at it.

I think this is because of how I always transition stuff to make sure I
don't have that much of a spread. As in the pages that contain open
items are as few as possible. About once a week I sit down and spend up
to an hour just moving stuff forward to deal with it.

One way to drive me nuts is by having some stuff I haven 't done and
then 10 pages of done stuff and so on.
