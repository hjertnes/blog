Some languages and / or frameworks force you to structure your code in a
certain way. I have always hated that. The reason is simple: very few
projects are at the right size for that structure. Because it is either
way too complex for your silly little app, or not complex enough for
your large enterprise app.

My personal preference is that the languages and or frameworks don't
force much structure on you. But instead give you good defaults and
advice on how you should do it. And then just let you do it as you think
works best for where your project is at.

When you start out learning something it might be the best to just have
on file, and then start splitting it into different stuff. And that
process is very good for learning how shit works. Something you lose
when you are forced into a structure.
