I have two pairs of headphones. One of them have a cable and hare big,
while the others are wireless plugs that are very compact.

When I go somewhere I usually end up bringing both. They are my Apple
AirPds and my ATH-M50x.

The AirPods are great, for what they are. And they are the best
bluetooth sound thing I have ever used, from a UX perspective. The
batteries are becoming worse, but still pretty good within the
constraints.

While the M50x is what I prefer to use, because it is really
comfortable, shuts out everything, and sounds way better. I love this
pair of headphones because how much you get for how little money. The
retail is $130, but you can find them at $100 if you have some time.

The way I do it is that when I walk around the house, walk the dog or
walk from or to the train station I use the AirPods because then I need
to be aware what's hapening around me.

But everywhere else I use the M50x. I don't want a Bluetooth version of
them, but what I miss is a Lightning version of their cable.
