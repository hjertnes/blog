My story with Kindle's and e-book reading starts with my first modern
smart phone. I got a HTC Hero back in 2010, and then I also got a iPod
Touch a few months later.

I started to read some e-books on them, and then around when the first
iPad came out I ordered a Kindle 3. It's the last one with a keyboard on
it. And I used that until late 2012 when I bought the first Kindle
Paperwhite.

That one died a few years later, and I replaced it with a iPad mini. And
when that died I didn't replace it.

Some time after I didn't have a dedicated e-book reader my e-book
reading went way down. So this year I decided to finally get one again.

I went for the cheapest model, the Paperwhite. It is great, the reading
experience is awesome, the side lights are great when you read in the
dark.

The general feel of the UI is still klunky and slow though. And the
process of setting up a new Kindle isn't great. It comes paired with
your Amazon account, but it still takes forever to download the books
and all of that.

Anyways. It is a great device, and I recommend having a dedicated device
if you want to read more e-books.
