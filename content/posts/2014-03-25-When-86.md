Yesterday was one of the first times, since I can't remember where I
wrote, but didn't. The truth is that I think I wrote five drafts, and
about 7500 words. But none of them were what I wanted them to be.

The last time I did something like that, was last year; I think.

I believe all writers get themselves into that corner from time to time.
There are just one thing to do: leave it, and try again some other time.
What you did wasn't a waste of time. You can always try to do something
about the drafts some other time.

The way I work, when I decide to write for this website, is to either
pick an idea from OmniFocus, or something from the top of my head. Then
I write, and I just leave it in Byword if I don't like it. And then I
repeat it for a while. Most times I end up with something I think is
_good_ after 1-3 times.

My philosophy to write is the following: -- Keep every draft. They might
end up as something great -- some day.

-   Keep on writing.

-   Try -- give it a real try; and take an early night if it's one of
    those nights where you just can't write anything good.

-   Get back to it the next day

You might not be the next Bukowski, but you will get a better writer, if
you keep on writing.
