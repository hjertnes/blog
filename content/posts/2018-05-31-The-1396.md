I fucking hate the "Please enter your password" dialog on iOS. It is the
worst. It shows up out of nothing, with no information about why. Then
it is no easy way to get the password from 1Password and enter it. Apple
got to change this with the next major version of iOS.

1.  Show some kind of notification like today, but without a password
    field. With information about what triggered it and why.
2.  Have a place in settings where you go to enter it.
