Some people like it the right way, while others want it their way. I
prefer listening to podcast as fast as possible, with smart speed
enabled. While other want it the "right" way.

I have come to the point in my life where I don't give a fuck. Do it
your way, just find something you are a purist about; but remember, it
is like religion or a penis, it's okay to have it, just don't show it in
someones face.
