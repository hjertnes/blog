Great writers read a lot, is a famous quote. And it's also one of the
greatest lessons for any aspiring writer. But. That's not everything.

One of my sources of inspiration during the last year and a half have
been podcasts.

I think one of my strengths as a writer and creative is to pick up
simple ideas and write about them.

I'm not the kind of writer that sit and stare at a empty document. I
just get an idea, and then I write. Like Ernest Hemingway once said:

> There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter
> and bleed.

All I need is a simple idea and something to write on; a phone, tablet,
computer, notebook or even a napkin. And then I just write what's inside
my head. Often just my inner monologue. Edited for the public. Mainly to
make it understandable for other people than me. But I never edit the
content.
