Tower, the awesome git app for Mac and Windows are moving to a
subscription model. I'm not against subscriptions. Seriously. I'm not.
But I'm not going to subscribe to Tower, because I think it is too
expensive. The yearly price will be the same as I have paid for both
versions up to this date. I would not have any problems with the
subscription if it was somewhere between $20 and $25 a year.
