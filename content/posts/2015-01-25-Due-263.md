Due have been on my radar for a while. It looks like the perfect thing
for people that want something like reminders, only a little bit better.
In other words, people that want something to handle reminders, and not
project management(GTD)

I have gone back to pen & paper as my main GTD system over the last few
weeks; and I think I'll check out Due in a few weeks.
