It have gone over a month since I deleted Overcast and decided to at least take a break from podcasts, and maybe quit them forever. It was a result of a slowly removing a lot of podcasts from my subscriptions over 15 months.

What I have noticed this far over this period is that I listen to a lot more music and I am discovering a lot of music I haven't been listening to before. And of course a lot more audiobooks.

I have not missed podcasts at all, but I do feel very disconnected from the communities like the Apple Tech Podcast / Relay.fm / 5by5 world that I have been following for so long. I think the change is good, but I'm still trying to work out how things will be for me in this post podcasts phsae of my life.
