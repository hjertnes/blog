I have put together this gist

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

It contains what I think is a good starting point for building your own
configuration. It is bare bones and does not change emacs in any shape
or form. It just sets up the package manager and loads a macro called
use-package. A macro is kind of like a function, that evaluates into new
code instead of data.

This configration is the starting point for my own config. All it does
is that it loads the package manager, adds some extra package sources so
that you can have access to more or less every package you can think of,
then it sets up the package manager, installs the pakcages I list if
they aren't installed, and loads use-package.

If you care at all, I think this config is a good place to start for
your config, but also as a simple little snippet to study, if you want
to learn a little Emacs LISP.
