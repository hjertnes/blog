Different people like different writing instruments. Some like smooth
pens, while others like pens with a little bit more resistance.

I like smooth nibs. The less the friction the better it is.

I do in general also prefer broader nibs. I think they look better on
the page. And I just gravitate against writing instruments that feels
good to be, and look good one the page. In other words, the more ink on
the page the better. Some people like a lot of ink on the page, while
others don't.

When it comes down to ink capacity I have some very strong opinions. I
think pens with larger ink capacity always are more useful than those
with a lower one. This is because if you write a lot with pens, you
either need to have a piston filler, refill them all the time or have a
lot of them. Back when I was a full time student, I loved my Lamy 2000.
I filled it in the morning and I never -- not once -- ran out of ink
during a single day. The story is another with the Pilot Metropolitan.
That one never lasted more than a couple of hours.

If I'm just writing a few lines here or there then I often use my Falcon
or VP. But I always go for either my Lamy 2000 or ink up one of my TWSBI
Eco's if I'm going to write a lot. Or if I need a lot of ink capacity
away from home and don't want to bring a bottle of ink.
