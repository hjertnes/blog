I don't like imprecise descriptions, or definitions. And I hate passive
writing even more. The thing that fascinate me more than anything is
that people think they are content creator. What is a creator? A creator
and the creator is two very different things. What is content? Well,
content is more or less anything.

This bullshit need to stop, right now.

You are a writer, you are a podcaster, you are a photographer you are a
"whatever the people creating video's for youtube are called".

Be precise. Tell people what you do. Don't use generic terms. A content
creator could be everything from sending dick picks over snapchat to
writing a very popular site.
