Relay.fm is Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett's new podcast network. All
of Myke Hurleys shows was moved over from 5by5. All, except for The Pen
Addict have a new name. And he also started a new podcast with Casey
Liss.

I wanted to write about it, the day they launched; 18th of August. It
didn't happen. The short story is that I spent a whole week being sick,
and last week was just insanly busy.

[Relay.fm](http://relay.fm) is a fantastic podcast network, with great
shows. You should check them out.
