First of all: notifications are great, for what they are designed to do.
And the notifications themselves is not the problem.

When I think about notifications I always think about all the pop-ups,
badge numbers and all kinds of other noise that we get thrown in our
faces while using iOS and OS X. This is the result, not the problem.

My general problem with them is that most apps have them on as the
default setting and that there are no good tools for managing what you
want to see from all of your apps.

So, how do I manage this?

I go through Notification Center on all of my devices about once a
month, or when I get really pissed off about some app notification that
drive me nuts. I turn off everything that don't cause a huge problem for
me if it is not enabled. I don't have anything enabled on my Mac. On my
iPhone I have notifications enabled for phone calls, texts and a few IM
clients. That's it.

I use badge icons on both platform for all of the rest.

The reason for this strategy is that it makes the whole act of reviewing
stuff I should do something about, more of an active thing, than
something being thrown in my face.

I have Mail.app open on my Mac right now, something I don't have that
often. My dock is hidden and I have to move my pointer to the right of
my screen to see if there are anything new. There are no other way for
me to see that. And iOS is more or less the same way. I have to hit my
homebutton and browse through all of the screens to see if there are
anything new in various apps.

What if someone really need a reply on that e-mail? Then they call me.
There have never been a single situation during the last four years
where I have gotten an urgent e-mail or similar that have not been
followed up by a phone call right after. E-mail is not the tool for
urgent stuff. We have texts and phone calls for that.

You need to devide if you Mac, iPhone and iPad is a notifiation hub or
the places where you do and create stuff. Take your devices back. Create
something awesome.
