I agree with Marco, Gogole is not the problem, but they aren't making it
better. There is a reason I try to read as many books as possible every
year. And I moved to Duck duck go for a reason.

Curation is key. Both on the web, the App Store and everywhere else.

Maybe we need a search engine that give us the best resources, instead
of the most popular ones?
