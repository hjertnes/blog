There are two iOS reviews I always read, and that is the one from
[Viticci](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/), and the
one from [iMore](http://www.imore.com/ios-9-review), I skip the rest.
They are both long, insightful, well written and a joy to read. Check
them out, if you are interested.
