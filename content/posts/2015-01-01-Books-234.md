Patrick writes about all the books he read in 2014. I planned to do the
same last year, but never got arround to it. I'm going to do it this
year. This is the year when I'm going to write a simple book journal.
Nothing big. Nothing complicated. Just a few words about what the book
was about, why I read it, and what I liked or didn't like about it. More
or less what Patrick does in this blog post. And I think I'll publish it
at the end of the year.
