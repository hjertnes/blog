Using what you know is often a good thing. Unless there are a very good
reason for moving forward. That is the reason I moved to Jekyll. The
move wasn't that big. I know Markdown, and I love using terminal and the
shell. In other words: the move brought my a workflow that is simpler
and more efficient for me. Anyways, always think about the "why" if you
consider moving to something new.
