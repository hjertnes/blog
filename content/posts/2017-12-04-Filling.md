I do love my Vanishing Point. AndI guess it is the pen I use the most.
But there is one thing about it I'm not that fun of. And that is how
much of a pain in the ass it is to fill it when your ink bottle gets
low.

Like I have said many times before, the Pilot Vanishing Point is a pen
with a lot of compromises that are necessary to get a good, reliable,
retractable fountain pen. sing that converter I hate.

This problem on the other hand has to do with the nib design, which I
assume is that way because it was needed by the mechanism. Anyways. The
problem is that the place where the ink are sucked into the pen, is very
high on the nib; much higher than most pens. That means that the point
where you can problems filling your pens from a bottle of ink will be
much sooner with a VP than any other pen I own.
