I think John is right, it took Apple a long time to allow custom
wallpapers on iOS, four years, and four major OS releases, before we got
it. But this seems so much worse than a ugly wallpaper, and Apple rarely
lets us modify the interface of their products more than they have to.
And custom watch faces isn't something they have to.

They might do it in the future, but I don't think so.
