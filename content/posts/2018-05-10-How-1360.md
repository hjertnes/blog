Homebrew is an awesome package manager for Mac OS X. And there is one
thing about it that makes it a lot better than most. I deal with what
most people expect a package manager to do. Like dependencies and
updates etc. But my favourite thing about Homebrew is that all packages
are installed isolated from everything else. That means that you can
have every version of Python that runs on your operating system
installed side by side or both Mono and Chicken scheme installed on the
same system(both of them have a command called csi).

The way it works is that you can have all of them installed, and then
chose which version you want to "link". In other works is that
everything is installed in "/usr/local/Cellar/PACKAGE\_NAME/VERSION" and
then if you want to link python 3.6.2 to the python command you can link
that to /usr/local/bin/python by using "brew link".

This is very powerful, because package manager like Pacman (on Arch
Linux) will not let you install multiple packages that have the same
command.

Awesome and surprisingly powerful package manager.
