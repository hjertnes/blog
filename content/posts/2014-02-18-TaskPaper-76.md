TaskPaper themes is one of the many interesting parts of it. The themes
in TaskPaper is both what you expect it to be, modifying how your
TaskPaper looks: colors, fonts and text-sizes. The regular stuff. And
this is what you expect from any kind of theme support in apps. There is
nothing revolutionary about that. I wouldn't write about this, if that
was the case.

One of the things I love about the theme's in TaskPaper is the ability
to apply special formatting to tags. Yes -- tags. What I love about this
is that it makes it easy to highlight and make each of your main tags to
stick out.

Let's take an example. I want my [@today](<https://micro.blog/today>) tags
to stick out, because it makes it easy to see them when I'm just
scrolling through my main TaskPaper file. I also want everything that I
tag with either [@next](<https://micro.blog/next>) or
[@tomorrow](<https://micro.blog/tomorrow>) to stick out, both of them in a
different way; and less so than @today.

I'm baffled by how cool some of the features in TaskPaper is; the tags,
the themes, the search and the general flexibility.
