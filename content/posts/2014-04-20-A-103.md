about visual history of OmniFocus; from kGTD to OmniFocus. The
interesting part here is how similar the kGTD, and the 1.0 version is to
the current version of OmniFocus.

I think OF version 2 will be great. It will be the first major re-design
of the app, since before it existed1.

kGTD was a set of AppleScripts for Omnioutliner, that let you use it as
a GTD system. And most people look at it as the predecessor to
OmniFocus. ↩
