Edit is a great iOS writing app that is about as minimal is it could be.

It reminds me a lot about a app that Patrick Rhone had a role in back in
the Minimal Mac / Enough days called Pop (Piece of paper).

The basic idea is that you have an app that is just a large text input
area. And that's it. No sync, no files, or anything like that. This is
Edit. And it looks fantastic, has some really cool buttons to make it
easy to mark everything and copy it somewhere else.

It might sound very similar to Draft. But they are two different tools
for me. Edit is where I write something a little longer on my phone,
that probably will require a few "sessions". While Draft is where I take
quick notes and capture stuff.

Edit is very simple and minimal. It might not be your kind of thing, but
I love it.
