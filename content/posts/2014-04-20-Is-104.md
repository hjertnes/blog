I just published an article about Reeder vs ReadKit. First of all, I
wrote it a few days ago. But, now I started to think about something.

There are a lot of examples of apps that used to be the kind "everyone"
used. One great example is Firefox. And then Chrome came along, and now
most people use Chrome.

The same thing kind of happen to the RSS reader market when Google
Reader went away. Reeder for Mac was a extremely popular one. But it's
also been a _long_ time since we have had a functioning version of it.

I think most of the old hard core Google Reader users on OS X have moved
on to ReadKit + some syncing service. My question is: is it too late?
And the follow up question, that my article also touched on: what can
reeder give, that is compelling enough to switch back?

I still use Reeder for iOS, I think it's the best client there.
