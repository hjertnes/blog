I got my new iPhone a week ago. This is the first time I have spent a
large amount of time trying to decide which device to get. The reason is
the different sizes. I prefer the 3.5 inc screen over the 4 inc, 4.7 inc
and 5.5 inc screens; the reason is simple: I can get stuff done much
faster on the size than the others, and the 4 and 4.7 doesn't give me
enough extra space for the trade off to be worth it. That is the reason
is went for the plus.

I got the space grey 64 GB iPhone 6s Plus, with a red Apple Silicone
case, and I think it is fantastic.

This is what I think of the device this far:

-   The battery is fantastic. I always have a charger in my jacket and at
    work, I don't think I need any of that anymore.

-   The camera handles poor light pretty well, much better than anything I
    have used before; the only way I get any better results is with a
    DSLR, manual controls and a good flash.

-   The screen size is fantastic. This is the first phone where I can
    write with two thumbs in portrait, and the landscape keyboard is
    fantastic. You notice that this is a freaking huge phone, but Apple
    have done many of the right compromises to make as good as possible.

-   The weight is also good.
