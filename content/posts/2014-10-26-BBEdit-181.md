BBEdit and TextMate used to be the two text editors on OS X; like Vim
and Emacs for hard core unix geeks1. I was a TextMate user for a very
long time, more or less constantly from 2006 until today. TextMate was
by the way the reason I bought my first Mac.

TextMate isn't what it used to be. It became Open Source. And I have
been looking for a better supported editor for a while now. And I have
tried BBEdit many times. And I'm not the biggest fan. But I think I'll
give it a real test this time.

There are things from TextMate that I miss, but BBEdit is way better
than TextMate 2. It's supported and polished.

The good thing about BBEdit is that it just works. But it is kind of
weird. I can't decide if it's just weird, or if it is better solutions
to problems.

I'll write another post, when I decide what to do. My current options is
Vim or BBEdit.
