I got a
[Kaweco
Perkeo](https://www.tudos.no/produkt/kaweco-perkeo-fyllepenn-fullt-sett-en-av-hver-type/) from Tudos in the same package as I got the pencil stuff I
purchased.

This is the first Kaweco pen I have used. And I really like it. The nib
is very firm, with soft.

I'm not sure how I should describe the pen. Because it is basically a
competitor to the Pilot Metropolitan or the Lamy Safari. But it is much
lighter, and much more fun. It looks more like something a kid would
use, than the boring design of the Metro. or Safari. It also comes with
a moulded grip section, but it s not like the one of the Safari. It is
much less prominent and I did not find it uncomfortable to use in any
way.

One thing though. I keep unscrewing the pen instead of uncapping it. I'm
not sure why. Probably because I'm so used to pens you have to unscrew
when you uncap them.

I think this pen is better than both the Safari and the Metropolitan
because the grip section should work for everyone, and it doesn't have a
uncomfortable edge like the Metropolitan does. And I think this will be
my new recommendation as the first fountain pen.
