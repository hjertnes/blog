If you want to have some kind of rating, stars are probably the kind of
thing you'd start with.

I'm going to do the examples with movies.

I think there are two good ways to do this. Either by using a three star
system plus the option to order the items within the top rating. That
means that 1 star = did not like it, 2 = fine, 3 = i liked it. And then
you can decide if you liked Rockey 1 better than China Town. I didn't by
the way.

The second option is to go with five stars. I don;t think most people
understand how this one works. Because I guess most people have a lot
with three stars, and a lot with 1 and a lot with 5. This is how I think
it should be used: 1=don't watch this, 2 = didn't like it, 3 = fine, 4 =
great, 5 = one of the best movies ever.
