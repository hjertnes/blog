Tramp mode in Emacs are awesome. It is a way you can use emages to
naviagate into other contexts. Like over SSH to your sever, or into a
Docker container or to access files as root.

This is one of those killer features of emacs, that are awesome. Some
IDE's have something similar, but tramp is way more flexible. And if
Emacs doesn't support it out of the box, youll probably find a plugin
for it.
