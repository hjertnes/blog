Fair point, but I think there is a time and place for the different
business models out there. What I mean by that is that some models are
better for an app early on than later. The fact that there is a
fantastic app available for free does make it harder, but I do believe
that the market for podcast app will remain big enough for at least two
or three paid alternatives, including Overcast.
