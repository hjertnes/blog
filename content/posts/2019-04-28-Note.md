When I left the startup I was working for and started to have a normal
relationship to work, and leave it at the office I started to have a
problem with remembering where I left off when I got back to the office.

For a while I continued not doing anything about it, but then it started
to become ridicolus spending like 15 minutes trying to figure out what I
should be doing. So I added a Due reminder monday to friday to write a
note for myself 20 minutes before I leave. Just a few lines to describe
what I was doing and what I should get started on next.

It sounds kind of dumb, but have worked great.
