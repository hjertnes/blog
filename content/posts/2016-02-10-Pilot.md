  One of the exceptions was this Pilot Custom Heritage 92, which is both a beauty to look at and a workhorse of a pen. I think it spends most weeks in the bag as I love the broad nib, the ink capacity and staring mindlessly into the ink reservoir when I should be working.

This is the first Pilot pen I have seen in a very long time(except for the cheapest models) that have made it into my wish list. Iâ€™m usually not into the Pilot design aesthetic, but this is one of the best looking clear body piston filler fountain pens I have seen.
