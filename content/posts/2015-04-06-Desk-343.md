Desk looks really good, it's not for me though, for many reasons. The
main one is that I use Jekyll, and I prefer to just use home made
command line tools, plus a basic text editor to manage my site.

Desk is the thing for everyone that just want something basic; except
for Squarespace users; since they don't have a API yet.
