I have said this before, but I have to say it again. I love full screen
apps.

It might be one of my all time favourite features in OS X.

The thing I love about it is that I can just focus on one thing. Like
for example right now: I have a few Byword documents in full screen, and
I have one Safari window in full screen. And that's all the apps I have
running.

I can focus, on the two things that matters, at any moment. And I can
focus on the one app I'm working in. It's great.

Try it!
