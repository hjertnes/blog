I love having a notebook on my desk where I work, currently just in the
office, but I'd also have one in my home office if I worked there more
than I do(close to nothing). The only requirements is that it is A5ish
size, works with pencils and fountain pens, have dotgrid and ideally is
the kind where I can just pull off used pages.

I ended up using Rhodia DotPads. They are awesome, and since I started
to use them one of my team member have kind of taking the first step
into our world by also ordering some DotPads.

I'm very happy with them. I never liked these notebooks as a regular
noteobok, but they are awesome for disposable notes.
