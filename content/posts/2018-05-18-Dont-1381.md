We have probably all done it a few times or a few times a day. Taken all
the changes that aren't committed and given it the message "Stuff" and
pushed it. But what is the point with a source code management if you
just use it as a glorified Dropbox?

I have a few rules I try to follow in order to avoid it:

-   Only one change per commit; if you changed a bug and refactored it
    because it was a mess, then it should be two commits.
-   Every commit should leave the repo in a working order
-   Use proper commit messages, that explain what you did

The idea is to select what files should be included in the commit
manually, and not just take everything; and then to the same for the
lines in the diff.
