I wrote about an idea I had not too long ago. The idea was to take empty
Pilot Iroshizuku bottles, clean them and then use them as a inkwell or a
ink bottle for other inks. Because not every bottle of ink is the same.
Some of them are just a bottle, with a flat bottom. And that can make it
a struggle to fill your pens, even though there are a lot of ink left.
Especially with pens like the Vanishing Point.

I started doing this a few weeks ago and it works like a charm.

This got me to think about looking for something even better. But it
works for now.
