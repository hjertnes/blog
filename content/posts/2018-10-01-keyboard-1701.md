As I have been typing on this Happy Hacking Keyboard, I have been
thinking a lot about why I hate the modern Apple keyboards, parts of it
is key travel. But the thing I really hate about them is that the shift
key is too small. That shift key is a large part of why I type way more
wrong than I do on any other keyboard.
