I ditched Wordpress a while back because it was way too much work to
keep it up to date, and I always get the feeling after using Wordpress
for a while that it is too much for my needs. And I'm not that fund of
hosting PHP+MySQL apps either.

Then I used Hugo for a while. It is an awesome static site generator.
Much faster than all the others. But I ended up with like 75% of a CMS,
because I wanted to continue using MarsEdit and the Micro.blog apps. So
did what I should have done from day one and wrote a very simple CMS for
my needs. It's called JAC or Just another CMS. It has no admin panel or
anything like that. No formal system for themes or plugins. It is
written in Python, Flask and Jinja2; backed by a PostgreSQL database. It
supports part of the Micropub standard, and emulates the Wordpress
XML-RPC API. The goal is to get up full support for the Micropub
standard as soon as I get around to it.

It is very simple, and have been built around what I need, and how I
prefer to use a CMS. You probably want or need other stuff than I. But
it should be very simple to extend or change.
