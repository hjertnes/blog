The Pilot Metropolitan has a spacial place in my heart, it was my first fountain pen, and have been the pen I more often than not bring everywhere. It is cheap, has a nice nib, can take a beating, and I have never experienced any kind of ink leaking with it.

I ordered a new one a few weeks ago because my old one, while it still works, have seen its better days. The clip broke off a year ago, the nib is a little bit bent and the finish is far from pristine.

The thing that amazes me about it, is how much you get for your money when you put down around $20 for it, plus the good Pilot converter. A lot have happened to the Metropolitan since I got mine three years ago. The packaging is much nicer, you have twice as many nibs to chose from and many more colours. I went for a medium nib, this time, as the last time, and the plain black.

The colour doesnâ€™t look exactly the same as my old pen, it is less shiny and looks a little bit closer to grey than my old pen. The nib feels a little bit firmer and the line a little bit thinner. I expect this is because my old nib is a little bit bent.

It is well worth the money, and I think you get more for the money than with most pens. It is great, it is inexpensive. But I have two minor complaints, which is more or less the same as always: I wish there was more nib options, because I think a broad would have been perfect for me, and the ink capacity is a little bit too low for me; to be fair: this is more of a Pilot converter problem than a metropolitan problem; and the solution is to get two of them. Which is what I plan to do until my old one breaks down.
