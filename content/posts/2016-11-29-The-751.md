Magsafe 1 & 2 have been <em>the</em> gold standard for as long as I have owned Apple laptops. And they became so, a year or two after I started lusting after a 12” PowerBook. I was a huge fan of the original design, less so the version 2, but I still think both of them were and is the best.

I think more or less everyone agree that having a cable that disconnects when you are close to dragging your computer into the ground is superior to not having it. No matter if you prefer having a USB-C port or not.

But there are still things about it that I like and don’t like. One thing that drive me nuts about the new Apple chargers is that I need to buy three different things to get what I am used to get when I buy an Apple Charger. I need to buy the brick, the USB-C cable and the extension cable. This is ridiculous. I had a full bag of various Apple boxes, only containing the different charger parts when I bought this computer. (I prefer to have three chargers, one in my computer bag, one at by desk at home and one at my desk at work).

There are actually some good things about it too. But I just wish Apple could have a box containing all of it. The employee at my local Apple Premium Reseller spent 10 minutes locating the different boxes for a simple charger.

My experience is that one thing break in every single charger after a couple of years, the plug that go into the computer. I really like how you can just replace that part when it breaks. This is cheaper and good for the environment.

The general USB-C concept is good. You use the same port for everything. Charging, storage, displays etc. But it will be a painful period until we find out how many ports we need to have on our machines and until accessories are updated to use USB-C ports. Remember the days in the late 90s when we had one USB-A port on most computers?
