There are a lot of different advice around the internet about writing a
blog, doing a podcast and almost any other kind of content creating. Oh
man, I hate that work. But, I couldn't find something better.

My personal opinion and experience about creating content is that you
should put all the effort into showing up on a consistent schedule.

The most important part is to show up and do the work. Write once a
week, or every day. But make sure to do it in a consistent manner. And
the other part is about evolving. You don't start out as a John Gruber
or a Shawn Blanc. But try to always create content you are proud of.

Show up, and create something awesome.
