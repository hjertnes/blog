I've had this iPhone 5S for a while now. The first thing I noticed when
I got it, was the LTE speed. I think LTE alone is worth the upgrade.

The thing I noticed about it is that it's the only mobile internet
technology I enjoy using. My first phone with Internet was some Nokia
phone with GPRS. It was back in 2003. It was slow and painful, and I
barley used it for anything except MMS.

Four or five years later. I got my first phone with EDGE. This was an
improvement, but in no way usable, unless you had to use it.

And then it got my first device with 3G one or two years later. And I've
had everything from a SE smartphone to various iPhone and android
devices with 3G.

3G was usable. It was okay. But it's nothing like LTE.

LTE is faster than the wifi I have at home. It's cool to finally be at a
point where I could get by with my phone connection, if it was cheaper,
and uncapped.
