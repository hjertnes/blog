jQuery was THE SHIT like 10 years ago. I wrote my first large Single
Page Application using it, and it still played a big role in writing
SPA's using knockout etc for a long time. But the big question is: are
there still a place for libraries like jQuery in 2017?

I'm not sure if there is or should be room for jQuery with libraries
like Angular, Vue or React; because of the differences in how they work
with the DOM. With libraries like jQuery you treat the DOM as the
"truth", while with for example react you render things to the DOM from
data in Javascript. Then you soon end up with some "interesting" results
if you add some jQuery plugin or code that starts to change the code you
just rendered.

But I do believe that there are many situations where React or Angular
is 100% overkill, and a tool like for example jQuery is the right one
because you just need to ajax and a few click events.

Should you spend time learning it? I wouldn't. Learn ES2017, learn React
etc. And I think most people will pick up on jQuery very fast, if they
need to.
