I think spiral bound notebooks are the best, because they make it
comfortable to write in a notebook, no matter if you are on the first or
the last page.

But, there is a problem, I'm a lefty, and that damn spiral is always in
the way.

My problem to this have always been to flip the book over, and to start
from the back.

It is a great way get a "lefty notebook".

It is kind of weird, when I think of it, that there isn't left handed
notebooks.

Every lefty out there should try it!
