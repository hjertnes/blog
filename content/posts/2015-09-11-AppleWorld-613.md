> using the beautiful Retina screen on a 12-inch MacBook. My iPad Air 2
> was sitting downstairs, sucking down energy. After the event I began
> to do a thought experiment about whether an iPad Pro with the Smart
> Keyboard could hypothetically kick the petite rear end of the 12-inch
> MacBook or any other MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. Here are my thoughts,
> which I'd love for you to tear apart.
