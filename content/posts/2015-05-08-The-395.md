I use notebooks for many different things these days. My GTD system is
in Field Notes, and the notes that have a very limited life span also
goes in Field Notes. I write all my notes from lectures, studying and
meetings in a larger notebook. And I use a paper journal.

The reason I have moved most of my stuff over to pen and paper is
simplicity, they don't require a battery, and there are no distractions.
