I've started to bring Luna to the office, because reasons that aren't
that important. She's not a huge fan of not being able to walk around as
she wants and bothering who the hell she wants. But the first day went
much better than expected. She was quiet most of the train rides and
most of the time in the office. And she apparently hates the meeting
room as much as I do.
