I've had a problem with not drinking enough water for a while now.
Probably over a year. The issue have been that the water gets how, and
then I had the feeling that I just refilled it, and I dont' do it and
five hours later I have still just had two mouthfulls of water.

Then I started to research water bottles that keeps it cold. And after a
lot of time I spend a ridicolus amount of money ordering a 24Bottle from
Italy.

They are the kind of company I love, that want to make the one bottle
you ever have to buy. There are two different models, one double walled
that keeps your water cold for 24 hours and one single walled. I went
for the first option. I also went for a 850ML bottle. It is big, like a
bottle of wine. But I like it a lot. I can fill it when I get up in the
morning, drink cold water until it is empty. Usually a while before
lunch. Then refill it and it usually last me until I get home from work.

The build quality is solid, and I like it a lot.

If you are looking for a good bottle, with a lot of design options I'd
take a look at them.
