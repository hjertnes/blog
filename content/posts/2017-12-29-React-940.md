I have mentioned the existance of PureComponent, and you'll probably
discovered sooner or later. There is a difference, but you should
probably be able to safely use it wihtout any issues if you follow the
kind of ideas I'm writing about on this site.

The core selling point of using a PureComponent is that it will cause
fewer renders. This is achieved by doing a shallow comparsion instead of
a full comparison. And fewer renders is a good way to improve
performance without doing too much about it.

If you do a full comparison of props and state it will re-render every
single time a single character changes. While a shallow compare will
only trigger a update IF the address changes. You should probably find
my article about value types vs reference types if you don't understand
what that means. The basic idea is that value types (numbers, strings
etc) are values, which means that you are passing the value and not the
variable itself around; while with a reference type you actually pass
around the reference to the variable.

This means that React will check not the content but if prevState is in
the same memory location as nextState; and the same goes for props.
