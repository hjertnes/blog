I use pens and I use pencils.

This is a very interesting question. In general I use a pencil if I'm
just going to write down a few sentences. And then I go for a fountain
pen if I am going to write a few pages. And I go for a very specific
fountain pen if I'm going to write a lot (my Lamy 2000).

I also prefer a pencil when I'm going to write on the train or somewhere
I don't have a flat surface.

Pencils are fun, but you have to sharpen them way too often for them to
be something I can write page up and down with. Kind of the same reason
I preferred my Lamy 2000 while studying. Because it had enough ink to
last me a full day. Something my Pilot Metropolitan never had.
