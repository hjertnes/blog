I have never built anything with MobX, and I don't think I will, unless
it's forced down over my head. But I'm pretty sure that if I had the
choice between a job where I worked with redux or one where I worked
with MobX, I would have chosen the former; much like I would have if I
had the option between a job where I used React and one where I used Vue
or Angular.

I'm not sure how it makes stuff easier, but it does at least move state
management out of your components. Look
[here](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-boilerplate) if you want a
sample project / tutorial.

If you think functional programming isn't your thing, or something like
that I would look at MobX. One of the things I have heard about MobX is
that it requires less code than redux. But I don't see anything in MobX
that lets you place the state anywhere in the component three like you
can with redux. And the whole decorator thing feels a little bit too
much like Java programming for my taste.

I don't mind Java or C# as a backend language, but I don't think those
ideas are that great when it comes to frontend development.

It might be the right thing for you, even though I don't like it;
especially if you don't like redux.
