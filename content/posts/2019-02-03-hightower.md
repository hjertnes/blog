The Hightower is one of the best purchases I have ever done. I first got
in 2014, not as a part of the Kickstarter that started Nock.co, but as
soon after it that it was in stock and I had money to buy it. It have
been a part of my daily carry since then. I have had 2-3 pens and 2-3
fresh Field Notes in it since then.

It shows no signs of wear, and it looks like it was when I got it,
except for some ink spills. This and all the other Nock.co products that
I own seems to be made in a way where they will last forever.

If you look for a great case to carry a few pens and a few Field Notes
sized notebook it is the best thing out there.
