The Apple Watch reviews are out, and I trust one person above everyone
else when it comes to the first round of reviews -- John Gruber. The
review is long, but very good.

I use my current watch for many different things, but I don't think the
Apple Watch are the best for any of them. My watch is one of the things
I own and love because I don't have to charge it every night. I can see
the time, the date and the day of the week, and I can also time stuff.
Something that is useful while brewing coffee, or for being an asshole
when people are late.

These things aren't something the Apple Watch is the best at. The Apple
Watch is not for people like me that just want a watch, the Apple Watch
is for people that want more from their watch.
