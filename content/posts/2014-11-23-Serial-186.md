[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org) is without doubt
a great podcast. But it never clicked with me. There are many "radio"
podcasts that I just listened to in certain periods of my life. They
created the first spin-off a while back called
[Serial](http://serialpodcast.org). This is one of the best podcasts,
I have heard in a very long time.

They have done something very interesting. The whole premise for the
show is to back it with investigative journalism and use a season to
present it.

You should check out Serial if you haven't done it yet.
