I recently made some changes to my jekyll setup to have real DF-style
linking. And I have digged through all my favorites in Feedwrangler and
Instapaper. These have been links I planned to post. Some are new, some
are older, and some are old. All of them are posts that I enjoyed then,
and all of them are posts that I still enjoy.

One of my goals for 2015 is to publish more links to interesting things
I read on the net.
