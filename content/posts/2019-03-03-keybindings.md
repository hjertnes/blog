I think I have written about this before, but I can't remember. When I
started to learn how to use Linux I first used nano, and then I got into
VIM becuase the people that helped me used it. And obviously I became
one of the people who mocked Emacs for being an OS.

Then Spacemacs hapened.

During the summer of 2018 I decided that I wanted to learn how to use
the standard Emacs keybindings. I started doing it sometime in August,
and now almost six months later I can say that I am somewhat competent
using it. I'm not yet at the level where I can combine 25 shortscuts
into someting nuts. But I'm at least advanced beginner or a beginning
intermediate user.

This is how I went about doing this:

1.  I wrote down the basic commands I had to know, like saving files,
    opening files, quitting emacs, managing "windows" on a Index Card.
2.  I started a text file where I pasted interesting keybindings or
    answers to how to do something I used to do in VIM. And I used it as
    a FAQ while learning.
3.  Re-read Mastering Emacs.

The process was really slow and painful in the beginning. But after a
few weeks, and getting stuff into my fingers it sped up. And today I
actually prefer it to other keybindings.

The main reason I started learning it was because regular emacs with
evil is kind of slow, and what I think when I'm at the other end of it
is that Emacs makes a hell of a lot more sense after learning this.
