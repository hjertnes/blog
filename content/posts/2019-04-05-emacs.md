This is a short list of the stuff I use Emacs for.

-   General text editing and notetaking
-   All my blog posts are written in Markdown using Emacs
-   Notes are written as text files
-   Programming in JavaScript, React, C#, ClojureScript, Cucumber tests,
    Bash scripts, PowerShell scripts and probably a lot more.
