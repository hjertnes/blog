I assume most of you are either using for of or map instead of the old
school for loops these days, right? It is easier. But I think the old
school for loop is a work of art. I'm talking about the C style for
loop; not the foreach.

The way it works, is that the for loop has three elements
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<ul>

</div>

```text
<li>

  The Initializer(starting point)

</li>

<li>

  The condition(continue to run until it becomes false)

</li>

<li>

  Increment(do this after each iteration)

</li>
```

It is very easy to reversing it, without reversing the actual array:
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/9dc34bf86b9880826bfd47df73b8d32a.js>"></script>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<p>

</div>

```text
And then you have the &#8216;break&#8217; and &#8216;continue&#8217; keywords, the former will exit the loop, while continue will go on to the next iteration. It might be easier to use other styles of loops, but I have never found anything I could not do with a classic C style for loop; there are probably some, but I can&#8217;t think of any.
