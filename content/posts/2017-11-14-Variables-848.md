There are now three different ways to create a variable in Javascript.
There are many different minor differences between the three.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<ol>

</div>

```text
<li>

  When you create a variable with &#8216;var&#8217; you also add a property to the window object, this is not the case with let or const

</li>

<li>

  Var and let are replaceable, const are not; all of them are mutable.

</li>

<li>

  Let variables can be local to a block (see example below)

</li>
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</ol>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<p>

</div>

```text
I would stay away from var unless you have a really good reason to use it. Then I always start with a const, and migrate it to a let if I really need to replace it.<br /> Local scoping with let:
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/79423343c2f885b6cd208477ede22d35.js>"></script>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<p>

</div>

```text
The example above shows how lexical scopinng can work with let. But use it with caution, because it can be confusing for developers that don&#8217;t understand the differences between let and var. Example one and three shows how it works without local "scoping" and the one in the middles shows how it works with local scoping. The short version is that you can define variables with the same names in different scopes without them writing over each other. Very useful for variables that don&#8217;t need to be available outside and for using the same variable name for all temporary data of a certain type or use.
