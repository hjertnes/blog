It should not be a huge surprise to everyone that I’m not the biggest fan of the Pilot CON-50 converter. It looks kind of dated. Not that the design of a converter is the most important thing in the world, but it still looks like something out of the 80s or 90s. But my biggest problem is the ink capacity that leaves a lot to be desired.

To be fair, they have a lot of pens to accommodate, which probably makes it very hard to make something that have a lot of ink, is reasonably easy and cheap to produce and so on.

The new model is the CON-40. It looks more modern, and is slightly smaller. But I don’t notice much of a difference, if you just do a regular fill. But I found it much more difficult to push all the air out and fill it all the way up, than in its predecessor. My personal opinion is that is isn’t really worth it. It is faster, less messy and easier to just refill the pen more often.

Pilot are doing the opposite of what I want with the CON-40, they are accommodating more pen, by replacing the CON-50 and the squeeze converter with one. I get why; one less product to produce, ship and keep in stock everywhere. But I still wish they made a separate converter for the Vanishing Point to make it more “on pair” with the Lamy 2000.
