I have used Lightroom CC for a while now, and I'm very happy with it.
Everything about it looks and feels much more modern than the Classic
Lightroom. You don't mess around with Preview Generation or any of that
crap. You just import your photos and Lightroom and the Adobe Cloud
deals with the rest. If you like me want a local copy of all your raw
files you can tell Lightroom CC to store it at a separate location (or
the same).

What I love about it is that it is cloud first. That means that instead
of generating previews and a like on your machine, Adobe does it in the
cloud. This is good news if you have a great internet connection, and
not so great if you don't. But it also means that you can import your
photos any time, and still be able to use your computer while you wait
for the previews to get back. This was a huge problem with the old
version. I had to always do it outside of when I was doing some real
development or work, because Lightroom would occupy most of my systems
CPU for hours upon hours.

The one thing I wish they would focus on bringing back from Classic is
batch operations. For example to be able to apply "Auto tone" to a set
of images, and a button for purging rejected images. Other than that an
awesome app.

I know a lot of people aren't fund of subscriptions. But CC makes it
much more worth than previous Lightroom versions.
