Every time I order something online I have a lit of stuff I need, and another list of stuff I would like to get.

Well, that is a difficult question. My first priority is always to get all of my “must have” items, and then ideally all my “nice to have” items in as few orders as possible; ideally one order.

JetPens and Goulet are the two places I order almost everything from. I prefer Goulet because I love the company, but I often end up ordering from JetPens because their selection is better.

Pricing isn’t that important to me, because the difference have to be huge for me to be able to justify making two orders instead of one. Yeah, international shipping can be expensive. It doesn’t really make sense if the difference is a dollar here or there. But I do it when it comes to expensive items, where the difference can be large.

To pack as much as possible in each shipment is important because it makes the total cost of each item as low as possible. This is probably a non-issue for most americans.
