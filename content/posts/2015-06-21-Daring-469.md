DuckDuckGo have gone a very long way the last 12 months. I think there
are two reasons for it: Apple have made DuckDuckGo a option on OS X and
iOS, and a lot of geeks, bloggers and podcasters have switched over to
DuckDuckGo, from Google since OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 was released.

The next step is of cource to see DuckDuckGo as the default search
engine in browsers and operating systems.
