It's not the first time I have read this one, and it is excellent.

I'm an atheist, and I have big problems with religion on some key
points.

Most of it is related to how people that are not men, white or straight
are treated by most religions. But I also have a big problem with how
lesser countries like The United States of America treat atheists. But
my main problem is how we let religion get mix up with issues related to
free speech, health or politics.

-   Religion can't stop equality

-   Religion can't stop gay marriage

-   Religion can't stop stem cell research

-   Religion can't stop distribution of free condoms

-   Religion can't stop distribution of free syringes for drug addicts

-   Religion can't stop proper education, by demanding dumbass subjects
    like creationism.

I don't accept any argument that is only rooted in either religion,
culture or "we have always done that". It's fine, it is a part of the
argument, but it can't be the only thing.

Yes, I know that every religious person isn't crazy or terrible, or
both. But most religions are built on a foundation that makes it too
easy to try to stop the progress of society, and I hate to tell you, but
everyone that tries to stop progress, will loose.
