It is the goal of governments to establish the principles and absolute
minimum of what we are to expect from companies and individuals. And it
is the goal of companies to maximise profits for their shareholders;
either in short or long term.

It is the goal of individuals to make the best possible life for
themselves and their family, friends etc.

When a company or individual does something you disagree with, you can
chose not to have anything to do with that company. But they did not do
anything wrong, if they did not break any laws.

If you think that it should be illegal: do something about that.

While I disagree with what CA and Facebook did, and have deleted my
Facebook and Instagram accounts I do not think they did anything wrong
until some court concludes that they broke any laws.
