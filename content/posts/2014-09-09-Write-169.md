Some people like long articles, while others prefer the short and
concise versions. I have gone back and forth on this question many
times. But I think I have managed to make up my mind.

Some people like to read the kind to writing that contains long
sentences, complicated words. While others like short and direct
sentences, that use the simplest and most direct word available.

I read a lot of writing from both camps. Two of my favourite authors are
Bukowski and Hemingway. Both of them had a style that give me a lot, if
few words.

I don't care either way. Write your text as long as it need to be, but
also edit it down to be as short as it need to be. There are good and
bad ways to form a sentence. Some people are competent enough to write
long sentences, without making them hard to read. There are times for
complicated language, but rarely.

My style here on this site have always been to keep it as short as
possible, with the simplest and most direct wording possible. While at
the same time telling the reader what I want to say.

Don't write 35000 words, just for the sake of writing 35000 words. And
don't use fancy words, because you think it makes you look any smarter.
The brightest people, and the best writers I know, write short, with the
simplest terms in their possession.
