I have my last day as a developer for Sbanken on Monday, and I'll have 2ish of vacation, before I join Knowit Experience as a Senior Developer in the start of November.

I'm really excited about this for many reasons. Two of them are:

-   I'll be using a Mac at work again. After two years of Windows, I can say that everything I hated about it in 2004, is still more or less the same
-   And I'll be working from the city center. I might start doing some street photography again.

There are of course many much more serious reasons for why I decided to change jobs and decided to join Knowit. But the two above is very important to be, no matter how silly it may look.
