The Loop
[reported](http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/06/27/apple-stops-development-of-aperture/)
that Apple won't do any more development on Aperture. I don't think this
is a big surprise for anyone. But I think it's sad. I used to use the
app for a long time; before I switched to Lightroom.

Here is the basic story. I got Aperture when the App Store launched. And
then, as time went I got more and more annoyed by the fact that Apple
hadn't released a major update. So, I bought Lightroom the day they had
released two major updates, since the last major Aperture update.

Lightroom is a great app, if you are looking for a Aperture replacement.
And you can get a Adobe Creative Cloud subscription with Lightroom and
Photoshop for $9 a month.
