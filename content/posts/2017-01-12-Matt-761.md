I’m a huge fan of markdown, everything I write that is not code starts out as markdown, even on paper. What I love about markdown is that more or less everything about it just makes sense. It’s intuitive.

The biggest problem regarding markdown until now is that there haven’t been any books I would recommend someone to get started. There are many good books and resources, but most of them are better for people that are already into it. But this book is the first book I have seen that maintains the elegancy and simplicity of markdown and shows people what they need to get started.
