It's easy to make your software and services available to other
operating systems, when you need to. BB have done it, long after their
relevance went out the window.

The big questions is: would do it, when they were at the top? I doubt
it. And seriously, iMessage isn't that good. What about making iOS
available to other hardware manufactures?

It's probably hard to be a CEO at a sinking ship, but this is just
beyond stupid.
