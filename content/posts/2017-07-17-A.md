This is intended as a starting point after you have played around with a Pilot Metropolitan or a Pilot Pretty or some other kind of cheap fountain pen.

I suggest the following combo:

<ul>

```text
<li>

  TWSBI Eco

</li>

<li>

  Leuchtturm1917 notebook

</li>

<li>

  Noodlers Bernanke

</li>
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</ul>

```text
Start with either a medium or fine nib. You can always move into broader or finer nibs later.
```

```text
This combo will give you a very good starting point. The reason I recommend this combination is that you get a lot for your money, enough pen and ink to last you for around a year, and a combo that is easy to start with. A medium TWISBI nib combined with Leuchtturm1917 and Noodlers Bernanke is something I know has a short dry time.

```text
Dry time isnâ€™t that important. But I think it is good when you start, because it makes easier to learn how to deal with fountain pens. Especially important if you are a lefty.

```text
The ECO is without doubt one one my favourite pens, it is one of the three pens in my daily carry, and the other two is both priced at around $150(Lamy 2000 and Pilot Vanishing point).
