A fantastic post about reading and writing.

I often say that reading is good for you. And it is. But you need to
read the kind of books that will make you think, and think differently.
And you need to take some notes, write down some quotes. A books journal
is a great place to start.

And pick up some of the classics, some Plato, some Aristotle, some
Descartes, some Nietzsche in other words, the classics. There is a
reason people have been reading them for a very long time.
