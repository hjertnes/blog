I got the Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal in the mail a while back, and I honestly believe this is the best notebook available to run a to do list system, or Getting Things Done system on paper.

```text
My personal system is similar to, but not closely related to bullet journaling. I use a small sub section of [Patrick Rhone’s Dash Plus system], and I use things like underlining and boxes to put emphasis on sub projects or important tasks.

The reason I think it is the perfect tool is a combination of the page layout and the multiple page markers(!)(the Bullet Journal version has three, versus the two you find in the regular version). A dotted page layout is not something I have used a lot, because I’m mainly a writer, and lines are awesome when you write. But you get a lot of the same from a dotted line, while you at the same time get more or less the same flexibility you would get from a blank layout. And the multiple page markers, in contrast to just one is a game changer for me. Because you can for example use one to mark where the point where blank pages starts, where all the tasks behind this point is done and what you are working on.

I have written about the paper in Leuchtturm1917 notebooks before, and I still love it. It is for me the perfect compromise between absorption and dry time. Moleskine and Rhodia is on the other side of two different sides of the wrong compromise.

I love it, and it will probably be my task list / work notebook until I see something “better” or more shiny. And I recommend everyone that are doing some kind of task management system on pen and paper to at least check it out.
