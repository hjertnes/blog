I did the same thing for a very long time, I just moved the same OS X
Installation from one Mac to the next; from one version to the next.

My first OS X install survived from my first MacBook(which was the first
white MacBook), until my first MacBook Air, running Lion. I was too
scared to change anything. But it wasn't that hard to start fresh, and I
saved so much disk space, and everything was faster and cleaner.

These days I try to do a fresh install after running a beta version of
the operating system. So, more or less every year.
