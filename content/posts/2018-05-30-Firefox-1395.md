Firefox finally did something they should have done a long time ago.
They re-wrote their engine, and the result is that they are faster than
Chrome. I'm not going into the Safari discussion here, because the
Safari team have other priorities over pure speed, like for example
battery life.

The result is that Firefox broke a lot of stuff as a result of it. What
I'm wondering is how long it will take before plugins are updated -- and
how many that aren't. And what Mozilla should do about it? Starting to
hide all the stuff that aren't compatible with the recent versions?
