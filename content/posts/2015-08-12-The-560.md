Great post.

I don't have a problem with ads, like I have said many times before. But
I do have a problem with all the shitty tracking crap most ad companies
use. Like Marco I have installed Ghostery, and I will look into content
blockers when iOS 9 is out.

The ad companies have crossed a line, many times, and they force more
and more people over to stuff like Ad blocker and Ghostery every time
they cross it. They only have themselves to blame.
