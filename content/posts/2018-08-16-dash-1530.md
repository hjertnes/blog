One of my favourite apps on my Mac and on my iOS device. It is just a
simple offline app for viewing documentation.

You select the libraries and programming languages that you use, and it
downloads them. And then, you can browse the documentation in the app as
you need it.

I code a lot on the train, when Iæm on my way to or from work, and Dash
is a lifesaver there, because I can just look it up there instead of
having to wait until the train get to somewhere with reception.

Iæm not sure how much of a use case this is for everyone. But if you do
want a way to access developer documentation in a easy to use way,
without pulling your hair out or without having a internet connection I
would check out Dash.

This is one of those things that many users donæt get. Yes, I can post
to WordPress with the web interface, but MarsEdit is much more
convenient. Same goes for Dash. Yes you can use a browser, but this is
much BETTER.
