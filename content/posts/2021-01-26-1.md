I've been kind of unhappy with my OmniFocus setup for a while now, and the notifications on tasks have been unreliable for a long time. So I decided to scrap it all and do something else. Jack wrote [this](https://www.baty.net/2021/apps-im-using-this-week/) and I decided to take an hour and do it. 

I have migrated over to things, and restructured things from a lot of nested folders and projects to just a few projects and using Things's Headline feature instead. 

Very happy about the change.
