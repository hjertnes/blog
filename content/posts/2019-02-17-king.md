I own more pens than I far to admit, and most of them are fountain pens
that are great. Any one of them would be a great only pen for me. And I
have two pens that I carry every day: the Lamy 2000 and the Pilot
Vanishing point. I guess I use them the same amount of time.

They have different strenghts. The Vanishing Point is very convenient.
But the Lamy 2000 is the king. I just love that pen, it is my all the
favourite pen design and the ink capacity is awesome. All of the put to
the side, my favourite thing is how great it feels to write with. Unlike
many fountain pens it doesn't require any work before it starts writing.

If I lost all of my pens, I'd probably just get another Lamy 2000 and
leave it at that.
