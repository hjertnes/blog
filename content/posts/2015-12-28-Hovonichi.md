My second Hobonichi Planner arrived almost a week ago. The choice this time around was much easier than it was in February last year, when I decided to get a paper planner. I think I spent two weeks looking at every single alternative available, before I went for the Hobonichi.

I’m going to write a proper review as soon as I get around to it. But there are not many new things in the 2016 versus the 2015 edition. The dates and so on have been updated, the other big thing is that it now features serial numbers.

It is a great planner. My advice is the following: go for the Hobonichi if you are looking for either a planner or a journal, but aren’t sure what to get. It has 99% of what 99% of people need or want.

It is the thing that keeps my live together. There will be a post about my GTD system very soon.
