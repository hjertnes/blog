Not a lot of content changes this week, but I'm attempting to use Roam as my [wiki](https://hjertnes.wiki). Currently I have a private and public one. All the editing and writing is done in the private one. And then I export it. remove the stuff I don't want to be public and import it into the public one.

The process isn't as easy as I'd like, at the moment. So I will probably not update it every week.
