I try to keep my office setup as limited as possible. Because I don't
want too much stuff that might keep me from feeling productive when I
don't have them available.

My office at home and office at work have a few things in common.

-   Apple Magic Keyboard

-   Apple Magic Keyboard

-   LG 27" 4K USB-C screen

-   One USB-C charger

-   One Lightning charger cable, connected to a outlet

-   One Micro USB cable, connected to a outlet

-   One Apple Watch cable, connected to a outlet

And that's it. I just connect my MacBook Pro to the USB-C cable to
charge and connect the screen. And I have all the charger cables I need.
