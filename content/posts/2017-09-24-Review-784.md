Paw is more or less the same as Postman. It is an app you can use to configure more or less any type of HTTP request. It manages sessions, cookies and so on. And I think it is one of the most useful tools available when you do web development.

The reason it is so useful is that you make some kind of API that communicate over HTTP; usually a RESTful one; even though there still are some weirdos using SOAP, probably only of legacy reasons. This is the API your web front end or your native apps are going to talk to. But it is invaluable to make sure that they work as you expect them to before hooking them up to the front end. Because then you know where to start debugging if something isn’t working. It is much easier to do it if you know for certain that it has to be in the client side code.

You can probably do more or less the same with Postman as you can with Paw, I just prefer Paw because it looks much better and is a native Mac app.

What I love about it is that it supports multiple documents, so I can have one document per project I sometimes work on, containing all the requests I have used on that project. It gives me some kind of organisation, and I don’t have to re-create all of the requests between each time I use Paw.

An awesome app that everyone that do any kind of development that involve backends should have in their tool belt.
