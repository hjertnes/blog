Lightroom CC have become pretty great. It is a fresh version of
Lightroom where most of the heavy operations happen in the cloud. This
means that you can get away with cheaper hardware if you have a good
internet connection; or even an iPad.

But there are a few areas where I wish they would improve. Some of the
very basic editing features still miss. The big thing however, is that
they got to fix batch editing. One of the things that drive me nuts, and
have been ever since it first came out is that I can't tell it to auto
tune all the images I have selected. Or most other things I often do on
many pictures at once. The only way to solve it that I have found is to
make keyboard maestro macros that look for a pre defined number of
times.
