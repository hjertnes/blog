I'm always looking for great new content.

I subscribe to 63 podcasts and somewhere between 40 and 50 sites in
FeedWrangler. And I do suspect that I would find more or less the same
subscriptions, if I looked at most hard core Apple-geeks podcast or RSS
apps.

David Smith had a great
[episode](http://developingperspective.com/2014/06/26/0/) of
Developing Perspective the other day. Where he talked about a few sites
and podcasts that I hadn't heard about. Which is great.

There is always room for something great. I would subscribe to all of
them if I found a new podcast network with 40 great podcasts that I
really liked.

It's hard to find great apps, great blogs and great podcasts these days.
All of us listen to 5by5 and TWiT. But there have to be more out there.

I wish someone would create something like what
[MacStories](http://macstories.net) is for apps, just for podcasts.
