[Hemningway](http://hemingwayapp.com) is the coolest web-app I have
seen in a long time. And I want it as a desktop app on OS X, on my
iPhone and iPad. This is one of these apps that I believe in. I believe
it makes my writing better. And it could also make your writing better!

Here is the basic idea, you either write or paste some text into it. It
highlights a few key aspects. Difficult sentences, adverbs.

It also highlights words and phrases that you should simplify and parts
that you written in a passive voice. It also looks at how easy it is to
read your text, on a grade level.

It's a great app, every english language blogger that want to have a
clear and bold voice should use this.
