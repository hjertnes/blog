Let's talk about arrow functions versus regular functions. I love how
much more minimal and elegant arrow functions look. But I think we might
need to start being more mindful about what we use where.

The key difference between the two is that an arrow function shares it&#8217;s this with where it is defined, while a function either shares it with the global scope, or the context it is bound to; if you are using strict you have to bind it to something to have a &#8216;this&#8217; at all.

I see all the time that me and many other developers are using each one for all the wrong reasons.

Use regular functions if you don&#8217;t interact with &#8216;this&#8217; or if you are going to bind it. And use arrow functions if you are going to use the &#8216;this&#8217; of where it is defined.

A typical place where many people use regular functions where arrow functions is a better option is event handlers in React. And a typical place where people use arrow functions a lot, instead of regular functions, where they are not the best option (because we are lazy) is utility functions.

Be mindful about the differences, and understand what you are doing and why.
