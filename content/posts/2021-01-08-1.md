I don't get the whole WhatsApp thing. Either it isn't that big around here, or it's just that I'm not in contact with that many people. Might be both. 

I just use Messsages and texting for most of it. 

There are a lot of people I have no or a lot less contact with after I left Facebook, but here is thing, nobody said it would be easy or without sacrifice. It feels great to not use Facebook or any of the other properties it owns. Like WhatsApp or Instagram.
