This is the book that made me go from that dumbass that called himself a
writer, to the guy that have spent too many hours either typing into a
computer or writing in a notebook; or writing on my iOS device.

This is the book that started it all. I first heard about it on
[Back
to Work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590307941/ref=nosim&tag=patrickrhone-20), many years ago. I have the e-book, and I have the audiobook.
It is like GTD for writing, for me.

You need to read it.
