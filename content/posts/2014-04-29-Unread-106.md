Unread is a great RSS reader for iPhone. I have been putting it off for
a while, due to my impression that it was only for people that didn't
use Instapaper. Oh man was I wrong.

Ben Brooks put out a great
[article](http://brooksreview.net/2014/04/unread-rss/) about it today.

This is spot on. It's not as easy to send stuff to Instapaper, as it
would be with for example Reeder. But I still think it is more or less
the perfect RSS reader for iPhone. It makes it easier to read the
shorter articles right there. While I still have the opportunity to send
the longer articles to Instapaper, even though it takes another click.

It's a beautiful app, with a fresh aproach. I just deleted Reeder from
my phone.
