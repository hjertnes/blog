I feel bad for Marco, and I liked the original post. Most of what I
write don't go anywhere, and most of the stuff the bigger Apple sites
write never go anywhere outside our little bubble. A lot of them agree
with what he said in the original post.

People that read Apple related sites like Marco.org, DaringFireball and
MacStories have a context. They understand where it's coming from, and
why. I don't think mainstream media and everyone else have the same kind
of content. I really hate it when you see a storm in a teacup just
because someone don't understand the context.
