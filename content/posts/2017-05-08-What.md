I think using analog tools like analog cameras, pens and paper are enjoyable by themselves. And I use them as my primary tool in any situation where it isn’t a hassle.

My calendar is on paper(I use the Field Notes 56-week planner), I keep a journal(a Midori Travelers Notebook), my to do system is in a Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal(I also have parts of it in a Taskpaper file on my Mac) and everything I write, including this, started out in a Lined Leuchtturm1917 notebook. And I also keep a Field Notes in my back pocket; it contains my shopping list and the hours I work; it is the perfect format for the stuff I need on the go.

My guiding principle is that I need to be able to use the analog counterpart without loosing anything I care about, without it being a hassle. But the reason at the end of the day is that I think paper works better for me.

I write drafts on paper because its forcing me to do multiple drafts, I use a planner instead of an app because I can’t stand calendar apps and I prefer managing tasks on paper because I find it easier to maintain focus.
