I have been looking for a good "compact camera" for a while, and the
X100T have been on the top of my list for a few weeks now. This is not
the camera that will replace most DSLR or MFT cameras, but it is the
first really small camera I'm excited about.

Yes, I'm probably going to buy one of them after the summer.
