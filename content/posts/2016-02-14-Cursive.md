The <a href="http://www.cursivelogic.com/">Cursive Logic</a> course looks like the obvious place to start for anyone that want to learn(or re-learn) how to write in cursive. My cursive is horrible, but I prefer to write non-cursive anyways, and I always have. But I might order this course just to get better at reading cursive.

For me, the thought of loosing cursive, as in loosing the tradition of know how to read and write it feels like loosing touch with our origin. It feels like loosing the ability to read and write classic greek and latin. In other words it feels like loosing Plato and Aristotle and the History of the great Roman Empire.
