How you design your components will affect a large number of different
things, everything from performance to how maintainable your code is. It
will never be perfect, and don't try to get it right form the start. It
will just kill your productivity.

Use PureComponent instead of Component as your base class, it will limit
the number of re-renders and therefore improve your apps general
performance. And learn how to develop using many small components
instead of fewer large ones, because then the browser will spend much
less resources on rendering. If everything is in one large render
function (aka a component) then your browser will run through all of it
every time something change, but it will only have to run through a
smaller part of it if you have divided it into many smaller components.

Smaller components are also usually easier to make re-usable.
