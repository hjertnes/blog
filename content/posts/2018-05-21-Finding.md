The Ink Smudge from day one have been about finding the stuff I enjoy to
use. I have not always succeeded at that, but that have been the goal.

I'm not a collector, I just want to have some good inks, some good
notebooks and some good pens and pencils that works for me. And just use
it.

It all started with Moleskine and Pilot G2's. Then I got into the Retro
51, and then the Pilot Metropolitan and Lamy Safari. And then I started
to use Leuchtturm1917 and expensive fountain pens.

But at the end of the day the only thing I care about is finding what
works the best for me.

Fountain pens works the best for me, if it is long form. And pencils
works the best for shorter stuff. Leuchtturm1917 is the thing I like the
best for larger notebook, and Nock.co's pocket sized notebooks are
awesome. Pilot Iroshizuku inks are the thing that works the best for me.
And I guess I just started my journey into pencils, but I really feel
like after five years I have landed on where I want to be with fountain
pens.
