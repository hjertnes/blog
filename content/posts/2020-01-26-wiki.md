I'll try to do this each week. But it will probably more like most weeks. Just a recep of what I have been doing on my [wiki](https://wiki.hjertnes.blog). Last week I worked a lot of the template to make it show everything more likea a outline inside of a large cloud of entries and tags. And I also updated most of the pages in it. Plus that I re-organized everything into a intial structure.

This week I have added a reviews section and posted five new drafts I had ready to it.
