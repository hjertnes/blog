I have gone full circle, first Spacemacs, then Doom and finally my own
thing√∏ before I went back to Spacemacs.

It was a lot of fun, and I got a lot out of it.

Te mai nreason I went back is that Spacemacs have a lot of really nice
tiny details that would be really hard to re+implement by myself. And
they have improved some of the problems I had with it since I left.

For example start time is a lot better.
