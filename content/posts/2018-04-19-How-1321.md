I got my X100T when I was a Canon shooter. And then a year later it
died, and I replaced it with a X-Pro 2. The result was that I did not
use the X100 that much. Mainly because I prefer the X-Pro in more or
less every way.

Then I started to use the X100 again. I just leave it in the office,
with batteries and a 16GB card. To take snapshots. For, you know all the
times you want to take a picture, but the big camera is somewhere else.
