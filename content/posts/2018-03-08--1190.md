As we move into this more and more divided world, where the moderate
gets more and more ignored, and not just in politics I think we are
missing something.

I see a lot of people ignoring a simple details. And they are not dumb,
just a little bit let's say "unreflected".

People do things because they have reasons for doing them. As their
horizon of understanding changes they chose differently than they used
to.

This is the reason politicians and other leaders don't do what they said
when they tried to get elected.

You don't need to agree with the choices, or the reasons for doing
something. But keep in mind that most people have reasons they do what
they do. And very rarely they do something just to be evil or terrible.
