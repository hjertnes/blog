In general you don't interact between components, because they should be
independent. But you need to do it from time to time, especially if you
aren't using redux. For example if you have a todo app, and your
TodoItem component have a delete button, and you need to tell the parent
component to fetch data from backend and update the list of items. The
way you typically do this when you don't use redux is to send a update
method as a prop; the function itself and not the result. For example:

The basic idea behind the example above is that, if you need to run
code, in the context of the component above it, then you need to pass a
function from it down to the child.
