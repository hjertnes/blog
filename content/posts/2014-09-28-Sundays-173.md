Sunday is the most important day of the week. At least for me. I do more
or less the same thing every Sunday. I have a few repeating tasks for
every single one.

I have a few maintenance tasks, like tagging stuff in DayOne, adding
stuff to my calendar, and tackle ten items in 1Password that need to be
changed.

Sunday is the day where I do everything I need to do, to make sure that
the coming week runs as smoothly as possible.

The great thing about it, is that I get all the larger things out of the
way in the beginning. And I know what I'm going to do each day. And I
can do more work in the beginning, if I need to do something else in the
end.

I prefer to have the overview, because it makes everything so much
easier.
