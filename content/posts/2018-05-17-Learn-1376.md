There are some languages you learn for fun, others you learn because you
have to and some that you learn because of the job market. And then you
have those you or some of us learn because learning them will bring a
way to look at things with them. One of these languages are LISP. LISP
is not one language but rather a family of languages.

I seriously think that doing a real project in a LISP like for example
Clojure would do most developers some good. Because you will learn how
to use a really simple, but beautiful language. And how to solve
problems in a beautiful and understated way with many small functions
instead of a huge class.

It's probably not for everyone. But I think it will bring a perspective
and a understanding that you will not get from something like C++ or
Java.
