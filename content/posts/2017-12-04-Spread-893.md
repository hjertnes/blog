Spread is a very powereful expression that both makes some stuff easier,
and makes other things possible that were close to impossible without
it. What it does is to extract the content of either a array or an
object. Below is an example showing how to use spread on objects and
arrays to make a copy of them and to pass the content (not the array or
object itself) as parameters to a functions. The object spread is also a
very elegant way to pass dynamic data to React components.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/b26d1eb241b91d02933a7e226ca64d97.js>"></script>

</div>

I know I say this a lot, but this is one of my favourite modern
Javascript features. One side note: the object version of spread is
currently in draft stages.
