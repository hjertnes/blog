Minimalism is a subject I have been obsessed with since I was an avid
listener of the Enough Podcast. My impression is that a lot of people
have a misleading impression about what it means. You probably think
about some Steve Jobs like person sitting in an empty apartment drinking
tea and meditating.

The idea is not to have nothing, the idea is to have less. If you take
everything you own, and you question everything, and get rid of
everything that doesn't fulfil one of two purposes: you need it; it
makes your life better in a meaningful way. For example I need a few
pairs of shoes, but I do not need 100 of them. I do not need a large
computer screen, but it improves my life in certain situations in a
meaningful way. Like for example making it easier to work at home.
