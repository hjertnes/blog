The whole gamer gate thing is even more out of control than what I
thought. This is beyond stupid, beyond horrible and beyond what anyone
should experience in any open democratic country in 2015.

I know there are a lot of male bullshit happening in software companies,
and I hate it; but this is horrible.

Everyone out there that thinks thinks this is okay, you are the Ku Klux
Klan of 2015. Go home, shut up, the history isn't on your side, and your
children and grand children will be embarrassed.
