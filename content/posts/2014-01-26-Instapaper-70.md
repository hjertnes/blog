I was sitting the other day and reading through my Instapaper queue, and
I realised that something had to change. Instapaper have always been the
place I go to read, and I just add anything that seems interesting. One
of the problems with this strategy is that it might take a week, and it
might take six months before I get to any article I add.

The result was that I came up with a set of three question, that I'm
going to apply to anything I add to Instapaper from here on.

-   Would this article be interesting in three months?

-   Is it something I'm going to read, and not just "skim"?

-   Is this something I both enjoy and find interesting?

I think and hope that the end result after using these rules for a while
will be fewer, but better articles in my Instapaper queue. But also a
more enjoyable experience in general.
