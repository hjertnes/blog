As React have developed over the years, they have slowly removed
redundant nodes from the HTML that React renders. For example, when I
started something like this {this.props.value} would be wrapped with
spans by React.

One of the awesome additions to React 16 was fragments, I think it went
past most of us, because we were too busy testing out the new
ErrorHandling and performance improvements.

Fragments solves a very pressing issue that most React developers will
meet sooner or later. Every component only returns one root component.
That means that you have to wrap a lot of stuff in unnecessary divs or
spans to meet this requirement.

You can now wrap anything that you previously wrapped in divs just
because of "React Reasons", in either <> and </> or <React.Fragment> and
</React.Fragment>.

The result is that you _can_ have just one root element, without adding
unneeded nodes to the dom.
