I bought [Command-C](http://danilo.to/command-c) yesterday. And now I
realise that I should have bought it months ago.

Command-C is a pair of iOS and OS X apps that let's you "copy" or send
stuff over to your iOS device. It's not something I use every day, but I
use it a lot. It might be some URL you want to browse on your Mac
instead of your iPhone, or if it's a podcast you want to add to
Instacast on your phone.

It's great.

This is something that should be a part of the operating system.

Anyways, it's great app. and you should go and get it. The OS X app is
free and the iOS app costs $3.99. Go and get it!
