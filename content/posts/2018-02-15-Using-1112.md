I often find myself in the situation where I have a lot of components
with a lot of the same functionality with different UI. With that I mean
that the state is more or less the same, and the methods in the
component to deal with that are also the same. But the UI is different.

A thought I had a few months ago, was to do this in a classical Object
Oriented way. Where you define all the commonalities in a super class.
But I haven't had the time to test it before today.

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/deb3a70fcf4b6bffb88d9985e9900d96.js>"></script>

</div>

Does it work? Yup. It can be an efficient way to limit redundant code in
some scenarios.

The basic idea is that you extend from React.Component / PureComponent
in one class, and define everything that is shared between your
components there. And then you extend from the class you just defined
instead of Component / PureComponent all the places where you need to
access those methods.
