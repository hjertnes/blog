Linus are taking a break, and he will hopefully come back as a less
horrible person.

It is because of him and people like him that I have never gotten into
contributing on any kind of Open Source projects. My impression is that
stuff have improved a lot since I had the time to do this, and Codes of
Conducts seems to have improved stuff a lot.

What I hope for is that Linus, and people like him either change or get
lost. Because people that are angry at you because you fucked up
something trivial on some code you fixed on your free time fore free
should not be celebrated.
