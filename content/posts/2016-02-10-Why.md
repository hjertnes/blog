  There’s a reason this pen has been around for half a century. In fact, there are a lot of reasons and they are the same reasons I carry this pen with me nearly everyday. I’m not afraid to throw it in a pants pocket or bag or pen case because I know that it can take a few knocks and perform flawlessly. And it’ll do so all day, everyday.

I could not agree more, my Lamy 2000 was my preferred EDC and pocket pen from I got it, until I started using the Hightower again four or five months ago.
