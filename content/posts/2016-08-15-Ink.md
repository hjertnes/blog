The bottle is one of the most beautiful bottles I have seen. My only complaint about it is that the bottom of the bottle is flat, many bottles have a hole at the bottom to make sure that you can use as much of the ink as possible. Everything about this bottle is beautiful, but I do miss some information about the name of the ink on it, there isn’t any information at all on the bottle itself. Design is about beauty, usability and practicality, and it leans too much in the beauty direction.

I never do any dry time tests with any of my inks. There are probably some value to them, but I usually start by writing with the ink on the different notebooks I use. My problem with the standard dry time test is that there are so many other factors than the ink that will have an important role in the dry time like pen, nib and paper. The dry time with this ink is not super fast, but still fast enough to not be any issue at all for me. Left handed beginners might struggle a little, but everyone else will not have any issues.

This is not a ink I would have bought myself. But it have gotten me interested in J Herbin and a little bit more “exotic” inks. And it will be something I’m considering in the future.

I usually go for ink colours that are clearly a colour. For example, that is a blue and clearly a blue. This ink has a beautiful brown colour with some hints of red. I would call it a redish-brown. It also have some cool gold shimmer in it.

You can use this ink with, and without the shimmer, shake the bottle before you fill it up, if you want them. They do alter the colour a little bit, I don’t notice much difference. But I clearly see the gold, when I look the the page from an angle.

This is a highly saturated ink, so use it with some caution.

The conclusion is that I really like this ink. The colour is very nice, and it is something I can use both at home and at work without people fussing too much about it. For me, the key thing about any ink is the dry time. To be something I’m going to use, it has to be short enough for me to not notice it, this ink falls in that category. And it’s fun to look at the dried ink from an angle to see the gold.
