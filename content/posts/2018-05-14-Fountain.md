What makes fountain pens and pencils interesting is that both are very
much a "high maintenance" writing instrument.

The fountain pen is messy and the pen is clean.

I'm not saying that one is better than the other, because they are not.

Fountain pens are a mess, because they sometimes are leaking, you need
to make sure they don't dry up. You also have to clean them to make sure
that they work properly. But the great thing about a fountain pen is
that you can write for a very long time without having to do anything
about them.

Pencils on the other hand requires you to sharpen them, either when you
write all the way into the wood, or when the point becomes too sharp for
your taste. But they don't leak, and they always work, as long as you
keep them sharp.

I kind of enjoy both. But sometimes I wish I could just use a regular
Bic like a normal person.

What makes both pens and fountain pens interesting though is that both
are very personal. And you have to weigh up the different pros and cons
the different choices have to figure out what's the best for you. Parts
of it is how you like the writing experience to be, while other parts of
it is about how you like your handwriting or drawings to look.

Neither is perfect, but I enjoy them both.
