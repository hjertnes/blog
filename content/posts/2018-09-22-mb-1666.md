Micro.blog is a "social network" built on top of the open web and the
indieweb. This means that most of it is decentralized. With a few
noteable exceptions. This blog post is intended to be a short summary of
how it all ties together.

When you register a user at Micro.blog you get a @-username, by default
you also get a username.micro.blog site, if you chose to you can
continue to use this as your micro.blog if you want to or you can set up
your own web site somewhere else.

All posts lives in your own site, while replies lives on Micro.blog. The
only thing your site needs to have is a RSS or JSON feed that you add to
your Micro.blog user. I have three sites connected to mine.

Then, if you wish to use the Micro.blog apps to update your site it
either have to support Micropub or MetaWeblogAPI.

That's it.
