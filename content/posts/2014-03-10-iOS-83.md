Apple just released iOS 7.1. It feels like a high number of iOS
releases(minor and major) come out, when I'm not at home.

This is the point release to iOS that I have been looking forward to the
longest. I didn't expect iOS 7 to be any better than it was. I'm kind of
impressed over how stable it was.

I know how buggy the first releases after major re-designs or
re-factoring can be. I've done quite a few of them myself.

Check out the
[release
notes](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1732?viewlocale=en%5FUS&locale=en%5FUS) if you want the details.

I have not played much with this release -- yet. But, my first
impressions are that this release fixes a lot of design issues. Apple
have fixed many of the UI elements that looked a bit "not quite there",
in this release. It also feels a lot faster, than the version 7.0.x
releases.

I have been thinking about upgrading my iPhone 4S, to an 5S lately. I'll
might put it off for a while, if this release makes my 4S more usable
again.
