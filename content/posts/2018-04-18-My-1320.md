I have a shit load of code on my computer. Most of it is either in use
or used to be in use; and was made to solve some kind of problem I
wanted to solve.

I have made an effort over the last year or so to make sure that as much
of possible of the code I have laying around on my system is on GitHub
in a form where it is useable to other people.

Why? I don't know. Most of it was because I wanted to have more stuff
there, I guess. And because it might be usable for someone.

It is also a good exercise to get into writing code that don't need to
be rewritten to be used by other people
