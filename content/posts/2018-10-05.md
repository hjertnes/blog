I have tried to write this thing many times. But I always end up
deleting it because I feel like it doesn't say what I feel about the
subject.

BaronFig makes well designed, high quality products that a lot of people
love. Or I just assume it is of high quality, because that is what I
have heard.

I don't like the products they make. I love minimal, but some times
minimal turns into this pile of nothing. That is what I think about most
of BaronFig's products. It looks good, but I don't like it because it
just looks like "meh".

I also have some issues with their communication, but that have been
covered by Brad Dowdy on the Pen Addict Podcast well enough for me to
not get into it.

To be perfectly clear: I don't say that their products are bad, I just
don't like them.
