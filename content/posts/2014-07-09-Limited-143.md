I join my parents at their vacation home once a year. And I enjoy it.
The thing I like the most about it is how quiet everything is. It's not
just less noise than I'm used to, but it's also less stuff going on.
Everything from life itself, to the internet.

I'm not one of those people that go "off the grid". I just enjoy being
places not reading e-mail, twitter and rss for a few days. Three to four
days, where I'm reading my e-mail once a day is brilliant.

I'm going tomorrow. And I look forward to it.

It's a great opportunity to take some pictures, shrink my podcast queue,
read a few books and read everything in Instapaper.
