I'm digging Doom Emacs. My config is not ready for day to day usage yet.
But I'm confident I'll get it there soon.

Why am I considering to switch from Spacemacs?

-   Prettier
-   Easier Layer/module system
-   Faster in general: both in terms of startup and general usage.

But I think it is a little bit harder to get into than Spacemacs, and
keyboard shortcuts etc are different.
