Most mainstream programming languages are synchronous, which means that
it runs line one, and when that's finished in continues to the next one
etc. While in asynchronously programming a lot of things are going on at
once. There are good and bad sides to both. I personally think that
asynchronously is the way to go if you are building user interfaces
because you don't need to deal with firing off threads etc when a user
clicks a button. The bad side is that some people find it confusing and
that the code is a little bit more complicted by necessity. The way we
deal with stuff that takes an unknown amount of time in asynchronously
languages like for example Javascript is that you define a method(or
apair of methods in some cases) to be ran when it succeeds or
experiences some kind of error. For example like this:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/89edf838bfd0c30d930cba14255182d9.js>"></script>

</div>

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<p>

</div>

```text
Some libraries use a single function, like above, while others, like jQuery (not that jQuery is a good example of anything these days) use a separate callback for success and error. But the basic idea is that the function (or functions) you define will run when an error occurs or you get a response.
```

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

</p>

</div>
