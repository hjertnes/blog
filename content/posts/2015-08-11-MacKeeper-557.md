Great news. I fucking hate MacKeeper. The product is one thing, but
their shitty marketing and scamming tactics are something entirely
different. If [Onyx](http://www.titanium.free.fr/index.html) and
[CleanMyMac](http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac) are two complimentary tools
that do some thing; the only difference is that they don't scam people,
and they **work**.
