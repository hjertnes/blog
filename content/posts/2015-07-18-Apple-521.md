Great to see some new iPod's. The Nano and Shuffle models are great if
you want a simple device to use while working out. And it is fantastic
to see a new iPod Touch model, it is a great device for testing beta's,
giving to kids or and for developers that need to test compability on
multiple versions of iOS.
