**The Cramped:**

> I've begun digging my way through Henry David Thoreau's Journal and am
> struck by how many of his early entries are, like mine and I suspect
> many others, filled with angst and doubt about the purpose of such an
> exercise. I find it quite comforting to know that even one of
> literature's great writers and thinkers struggled to keep a journal,
> questioned the entire idea of it, did so only in fits and starts, but
> kept at it all the same. And, by doing so, even haphazardly, bore such
> great fruit and insights about nature, philosophy, community, and
> solitude to be enjoyed well over a century later.
