I'm mostly a one ink in all of my pens kind of person. But I have slowly
been accepting that some of my pens just don't work with all inks. Like
my two Pilot pens in rotation (Metal falcon and Vanashing point) aren't
the best unless the ink is really good lubricated. So I have more or
less given up using them with anyhting but Iro inks.

While all my rest have good enough flow through the feed to handle most
inks.
