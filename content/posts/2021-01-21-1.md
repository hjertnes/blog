Decided to give Safari and NetNewsWire another go yesterday. 

Safari is really good, and I love how much better it looks compared to Firefox or Chrome. I'll probably still have to use Firefox for a lot of development stuff because the browser extension stuff for Safari is still a fucking cluster fuck. 

There is one thing about Safari that I really hate. If you pin a bunch of tabs, and close the last unpinned tab the browser window will close. It is a weird behaviour.

NetNewsWire is really good. It is probably the best RSS reader I have used in a really long time. I'm mostly happy with it, but I miss being able to map keyboard shortcuts like Reeder and ReadKit has. Where you can tell it to do things like "Clear out read articles", "open in browser", "send to instapaper" etc when you type a single letter. I've kind of replicated some of them with CMD+letter. But I'd love to not having to do that.
