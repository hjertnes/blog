Emacs LISP is a programming language, that most of Emacs is implemented
in, except for a small C core. This is what you use to configure Emacs
or to extend it. I'm not going to do a real introduction to it here. The
Emacs LISP introduction available in Emacs or on the GNU website is a
great place to start.

LISP looks weird, but it is beautiful, and you either learn to accept it
or love it once you get used to it. But there are a few things you
should know that I thought was useful while I was learning to code in
LISP for the first time.

Everything is a function in lisp. You don't have operators like `= or
!`, but instead everything is a function. What you would write as
functionName(param1, param2) in Java or C would be (function-name param1
param2) in LISP. It is not that different to be honest. e

It can take a while to get used to it, but I honestly love it. My dream
job is to have one where I can write LISP all day.
