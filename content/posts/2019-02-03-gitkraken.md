I've been very skeptical about this app, for a really long time. I never
got what the fuzz was about. It is a electron, subscription, freemium
app. Talking about hitting all the hate points out there. But it is
awesome.

It is a fantatic Git App, but it is not the best App in the world. It is
very cross platform.

If you have used a git app for any amount of time, there are probably
some stuff annoy yu a little bit. Like dealing with merge conflicts
managing branches or even doing simple editing while committing. What
Gitkraken seems to be doing is to make things a little bit better all
places there are some friction.

Merge conflicts? You get a simple interface with checkboxes. Simple
edits? It has a very basic text editor. Changing branches, upstreams and
al of that junks are at most two clicks away. I have used it for a
couple of months by this point, and I really like it. Not because it is
a great app, it isn't, but because it removes a lot of friction.
