> We are starting off by introducing two great new shows to our roster!

<!--quoteend-->

> First we have Liftoff, a fortnightly podcast about space, the
> universe, and everything. This show is hosted by Relay FM co-founder,
> Stephen Hackett, and Jason Snell, the host of Upgrade and Clockwise.
> You don't need to be a rocket scientist to enjoy the topics discussed
> on Liftoff, as they break things down so anybody that is interested in
> space can enjoy it.

> We are also really excited to be premiering Top Four, hosted by Marco
> and Tiffany Arment. Top Four is a really fun show, in which your hosts
> pick their favourite things in certain categories, like movies, books,
> and video games. You'll get to hear two very opinionated people
> discuss and rank their favourites, whilst also getting to hear the
> awesome chemistry of the Arments. It's a really fun show that I think
> you'll love.

To new fantastic shows on my favourite podcasting network.
