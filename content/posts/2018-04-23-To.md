I guess this comes as a response to recent discussions on The Pen Addict
podcast about keeping journals or not. My collection of notebooks is
growing. And it grows some every year. The big question is: what should
I do about them?

One option is to just keep them and let future generations deal with it.
Not unlike how my parents and grand parents generations dealt with
climate change.

Another option is to throw it all out.

And the third is to throw out some of it.

A lot of it is just notebook after notebook after notebook of tasks.
While other parts are notes I have taken while reading or studying. And
some of it is journaling.

Here is the thing: I'm probably the worst judge to what's interesting.
And I'm not one of those who care what happens after I'm dead and
buried.
