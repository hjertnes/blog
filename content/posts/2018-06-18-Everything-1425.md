If you are a software developer, you probably have a lot of code laying
around. Because you needed something or wanted to learn something. But
having something that you can use and having something other people can
use are two different things. Because you have to make sure it is at
least kind of easy to install it, run it, configure it etc.

One thing I have focused on doing since the start of 2017 is to put as
much as possible on GitHub. I've had a rule: either I start making money
on it, or it goes up on GitHub. If it is something I coded on my spare
time.

There are many reasons for it, but the two most important ones are: if I
put it up on GitHub, I make sure that it is easy "enough" to install and
get started with it, that means that I don't have to study the source
code to figure out how it works between each time I use it. And it is
awesome if someone else finds it either useful or can learn something
from it.
