I've been looking for a good replacement for Django for a while. What I
like about Django is that you get everything you need to build a
database backed backend out of the box. What I don't like is how bad of
a fit Python is for functional programming, and because the type system
isn't that great.

Clojure seems like the best option I've tested out this far.
