I almost never sharpen pencils on the go. The way I deal with sharpening
them is that I have somewhere between 12 and 24 pencils in rotation. I
carry them all in my Nock Pencil Pouch; I don't remember what it is
called. I sharpen them on both sides.

I use them until they are too dull, and then I put it in one of the
pockets of my Tom Bihn Plot bag. And when I get home, I sharpen them and
put them back in the case.

I also always have a pencil in the spine of my Belroy Field Notes case.

What I usually do is that I keep pencils in regular rotation until they
are short enough to fit in there without the point sticking out. Then I
reserve them for pocket uuse until they get too short to be comfortable
to write with. At that point I just throw them out and find the next
short one to use.

At the moment I use Golden Bears and the Pink Blackwing Volumes.

My main pencil is the Golden Bear, but I try to test out most of the
other big popular pencils one by one, to have an informed opinion about
them.

I actually get a full box of every pencil I want to try, because I think
that you actually have to use a few of them before you have an opinion.
Because I often really like a pencil for the first 3-4 of them, and then
I get over the initial excitment and realize that they are really
scratchy or really soft. And get annoyed.
