Flash are already dying, there are no Flash on iOS, and the Android
version was killed a long time ago. I see some Flash on Facebook,
usually videos, and I once in a while(or year) see a Youtube video that
isn't available as HTML5 video.

The big question is: how soon can we get rid of the reminaing 1% of the
flash content on the web? My
[belief](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/13/8948459/adobe-flash-insecure-says-facebook-cso)
is that this won't happen before we set a date, or just kill the damn
thing; because they don't have any incentives to do so before then.
