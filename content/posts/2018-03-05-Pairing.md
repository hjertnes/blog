I'm lucking enough to own a lot of great pens. But that means that I
can't use all of them. Or I can at least not use all of them all the
time.

I own a few Retro51's, three Pilot Metropolitan, one Lamy Safari, two
TWSBI Eco, one TWSBI 580AL, a Lamy 2000, A Pilot Vanishing Point, a
Pilot Metal Falcon and one Noodlers Ahab.

The way it works for me is that the pens I use is the ones I have in my
Nock Hightower. It has room for three pens. And I have a system for
rotating the pens in it. Too few pens means that you run out of ink, and
too many means that they dry up or that you spend more time making sure
that they don't dry up than you spend writing with them.

My problem before I started to move pens out of rotation, first with the
Metropolitans and then the Eco's was that there was three pens I enjoyed
way more than the others. I love the Metropolitan, but I enjoyed the
other five pens way more. And I also loved the Eco's but I loved the
other three pens more.

The result was that I almost never used them, except for when it felt
like "I had to". Therefore I decided to clean and rotate out everything
that I didn't enjoyed the most. And I'll probably ink them up when I
test out inks.

My current pen carry is as follows:

-   Pilot Metal Falcon: Broad Flex Nib

-   Lamy 2000: Medium Nib

-   Pilot Vanishing Point: Broad Nib.
