Jordan Cooper was a guest on the last
[episode](http://5by5.tv/systematic/101) of Systematic. And he checked
out his podcast called [Tech Douchebags](http://tdb.fm). This isn't
just the funniest comedy podcast I have found in a very long time. But,
it's also the best combination between tech and comedy I have ever
heard.

Check it out if you are a geek that don't like "normal" people that use
tech wrong.
