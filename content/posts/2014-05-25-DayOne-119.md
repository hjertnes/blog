I got this idea while fundraising today: what is my all time favourite
iPhone app?

My all time favourite app is DayOne. The thing about DayOne is that it
is a pleasure to add pictures, write a few words or write many of them.
But it's also a pleasure to just browse through your journal and
discover moments and thoughts you didn't remember.

Everyone out there that want to get into journaling need to get
[DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com). My personal preference is to have it
on my phone. But the Mac app is also great for when you want to write
something longer.
