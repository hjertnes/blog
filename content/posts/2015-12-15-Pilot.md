  Ina-ho translated into English means ‘rice ear’ a name that I found very unusual. After a quick google search the name makes perfect sense. I think this ink colour is great for the Autumn/Winter season. It is a subdued brown/gold colour with some small hints of green. This is perfect for writing Christmas cards and looks great in my Hobonichi Techo for the winter journal entries.

Interesting colour, its not something I would go for personally. But I think the Pilot Iroshizuku inks are very cool. I got my first bottle today; the Take-sumi of course. You can go wrong, and you can either be like me and buy a large 50ml bottle or get smaller sets with three different colours.

I have state this before, but I am a black ink person, it isn’t often that I write with anything else. The only time I consider getting something else, than my beloved black, is when I look at the Iroshizuku inks.
