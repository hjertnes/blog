As anyone that have at least browsed around a little bit on this site should know: I love Pilot Iroshizuku. They provide me with exactly what I want from a ink. A consistent great compromise between fantastic colours, lubrication and short dry time across many great choices.

I think all of their colours look great, even though I know that some of them are a little bit too light for my taste. The ink we are talking about today have been on my wish list for a very long time. It have been on my wish list since the time when I went through all the Pilot Iroshizuku colours and made a list of all of the ones I wanted.

But I got some serious cravings when Myke Hurley added a picture of the ink in use to the show notes of a episode of The Pen Addict. And it is amazing. This is one of my two all time favourite inks, together with another Pilot Iroshizuku the Tsuki-yo. I would, without any hesitation order another bottle of either when I run out. Something that isn’t true for my other inks. I might, but it isn’t 100% sure.

As with all Iroshizuku inks (with the exception of the black one) I initially thought it was a little bit light. But I have come around (as always), and it is more or less perfect. This is not a “pure orange”, to me it looks more red-orange. And Iroshizuku inks are not for you if you want a “orange orange” or a “blue blue” and so on. But if you want a really good looking orange or a really awesome blue, then it is for you.
