I have been using Git on the command line most of the time, for as long
as I can remember. There have been periods where I have used apps like
Tower. Some of them are okay. Tower is a great one, but way too
expensive for me, and Fork is another great option.

Git clients in IDE's and editors on the other hand have always been
really confusing to me. I can never understand how the hell to use them.
The exception being the one in Visual Studio Code and Magit. What I
really like about the one in VS Code is that the visual UI is just about
about committing changes. You have some other UI like showing the
current branch, and some nice wrappers for running git commands through
the command interface and other places. But the main UI thing is
committing.

I really like it, because it makes it all really intutive and easy to
understand for anyone.
