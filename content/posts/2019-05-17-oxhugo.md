I love having static sites, because they don't require a lot of work to keep running. But I still have a full featured one at Micro.blog to make posting images and from my phone easy. One of the things that often keeps me from posting is the hassle of creating a file following the proper naming schema etc.

If you like me like Emacs and Org-mode and have a static site, I recommend taking a look at [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/). It is just a emacs package you can use to generate markdown front matter files from a org file. Front matter is the key-value stuff at the top of your blog posts that most static sites use. I think it started with Jekyll, but I might be wrong.

Ox-hugo is made for Hugo, but it should work with anyhting by adding some custom fields. I use it with my custom Gatsby setup on all my three sites
