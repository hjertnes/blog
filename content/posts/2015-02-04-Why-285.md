There are a lot of really good points there. I'm not a huge WordPress
fan, it's a good CMS, it isn't for me.

There aren't one reason why I use Jekyll, and there aren't one reason
for why I don't use WordPress or Squarespace; but the key reason is that
my workflows for managing Jekyll is way more efficient.
