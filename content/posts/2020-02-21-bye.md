Recent happenings here at Micro.blog have gotten me to taking a break from Micro.blog. It might be a short term or I might never come back. I have added all the RSS feeds of the people I followed to my RSS reader, and if you want to talk I'm always available on <https://keybase.io/hjertnes>. I'm not removing my site from Micro.blog for now, but I might do that in the future.

Who knows?

The reason I am leaving is that I believe Micro.blog has the oposite problem of Twitter. A lot of the time when someone are critical, negative or harsh people start to criticize it. Or sending me links to the community guidelines, even though what I said could not in any resonable proper interpretation be i violation of.

At the current state I don't feel like I can be myself here. It seems to me that the only style of writing that is okay here at the moment is what I would describe as "lunch at gradma" or "christian youth club". It is sad, because I do enjoy a lot of the people on here.

Bye.
