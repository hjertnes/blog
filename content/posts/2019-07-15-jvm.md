I just saw some Perl 6 implementation being built on top of the JVM. I
think that is a great idea for a lot of situations. Languages like Perl
6 or Python or Node or Ruby will in a lot of situations be used to do
web stuff. That means that start up time isn't that important, and you
get access to all the JVM libraries. Which means that you just build on
top of all them, instead of using a lot of time to do it yourself or get
others to implement support for your new language.

Clojure did it, and it is awesome, and makes it much more viable in the
enterprise. Before all of you start time nazis start commenting. The JVM
or .NET CoreCLR are slower to start, but have better throughput (Go
sometimes perform better, but that is a lot harder than most C# or Java
code). What does this mean? It means that instead of starting fast it
can deal better with a lot of requests.

This makes it a lot better fit for services and web stuff.
