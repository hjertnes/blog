Swift starts to look better and better. I have been thinking about
getting back into iOS development for a while now; and I think Swift is
the language. But I'm doing the same as Marco, I'm waiting at least
another year before learning it. Languages and frameworks change a lot
in the beginning. And I don't have time for that.

But I'm pretty sure that Swift is the future. And I'm also sure that
Swift will make iOS development more accessible for web developers; like
Javascript, Perl, Python and Ruby developers.
