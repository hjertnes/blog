The heart and soul of a Single Page Application.

A router in React maps different components to different urls in
different parts of your UI. Most people use it to control the content of
their content area. But you can also use it to change the menu items and
other parts of your UI based on the url.

The most popular one is called
[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). React
Router works fairly well, even though their latest version was a little
bit controversial. Or you could use my friend Asbj√∏rn's
[router](https://github.com/asbjornenge/tiny-react-router), I have
used it a lot in the past.

I used to use the latter when I started. Because it was easier to hook
up. But these days I use React Router. Most of it is good, and it is
very flexible for large apps. And you have different versions of it for
different uses. Everything from regular routing, to hash to react
native. And also a redux version that I think it awesome.
