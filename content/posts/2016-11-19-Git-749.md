I have used Git for a very long time by now, I think I started using it in 2007 or 2008. And I have used it in teams since 2010. Git is very powerful, but it isn’t the easiest tool to use, unless you find the right tools. Something that bothered me with Git from the start was how hard it was to set up a server to manage Git repo’s. It is one of the things where it is much easier to just use a hosted solution like for example GitHub.

There are three different Git repository hosting solutions I have used, and I think two of them are excellent.

All of them do more or less the same thing. You get access to git repository with various limits and some nice add ons for x amounts of $ per month. It’s pretty straight forward.

The cheapest option is BitBucket, you can do what ever you want for as long as you want, up to five users, and then you you basically pay $10 a month for up to 10 users, $25 for up to 25 users and so on.

CodebaseHQ, their pricing is also pretty straight forward. The only difference between the plan is disk space and the number of action projects; except for the cheapest plan where you also have a user limit, starting at 9 punds.

GitHub is the more expensive option, kind of. If you want a personal account you can get that for $7 and there are no repository limits; I’m also pretty sure you can invite as many users that you want to your repositories. But it’s kind of a hassle if you have a large number of repositories, and need to add or remove people from them. They also have a Organization and a Enterprise plan. The former is $25 a month (includes five users) and $9 per additional user. And the latter is if you want or have to host your code yourself ($21 per user).

I have used all of them with teams, and both GitHub and CodebaseHQ are fantastic options. BitBucket on the other hand is a fucking nightmare. I can feel the billable hours disappear like sand between my fingers every single time I have to do anything with the BitBucket interface. What takes me under a minute with GitHub or Codebase takes 5-10 minutes with BitBucket. There are a million different things in the interface, and a combination of deprecated features and stuff you actually can use. And the other stuff they include, like HitChat and Jira is beyond bad. Jira is powerful, but then you need a dedicated Jira Guru that doesn’t have any other responsibilities and seriously – use Slack instead of HipChat. PivotalTracker is a million times better than Jira anyways.

A personal GitHub account can work if you have one repository and some people working with you on it, but the GitHub for Organizations are fantastic, it’s actually easy to manage, and easy to deal with from the team member perspective in the GitHub web interface.

Stay away from BitBucket, use GitHub if you can or use CodebaseHQ if you need to save some money.
