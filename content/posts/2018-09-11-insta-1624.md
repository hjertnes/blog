If I find something of interest and it has a link I add it to
Instapaper.

Then, as I am reading each of the links I either read it and archive it
or I move it to OmniFocus if it is something that I want to do something
more with, like sharing it on my blog or buying it or testing out some
programming thing.

A lot of links move through my Instapaper each month, but I try to reach
zero at least once or twice each month to keep it under control.
