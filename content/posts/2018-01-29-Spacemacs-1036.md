Spacemacs have been on my radar for almost two years at this point.

I have been using Visual Studio Code for close to two years, and then
Sublime Text since 2011, and Textmate since 2008; and before that in in
between I have used VIM for close to 15 years.

I decided to try to make the jump because I was becoming more and more
unhappy with Code, and when I tried to get VIM to do the same kind of
things that was possible with Code the result was never good enough. But
then I discovered that Emacs might be the perfect fit, because most of
what I wanted was posssible in a more elegant and stable way.

The reason I never gave emacs a change was because the keyboard
shortcuts drove me nuts, and the learning curve was very high. But
everything was way more apporachable with Spacemacs. I decided to
initially give it a week. And I was sold after just a few hours.

The power of emacs have given me a real performance boost. And I have
moved a lot of stuff I used standalone apps for over to emacs since
then.
