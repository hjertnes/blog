I have been thinking quite a lot about the so called information silos,
during the last few days. Information silos are applications like
Evernote or Yojimbo. They provide some kind of database where you can
save notes or files. The main difference between this and using regular
files and folders structures are many. Tagging, and projects or
notebooks creates something similar to folders, but easier to
understand. But one of the best reason to use something like Evernote is
to now exactly where to look when you are looking for something.

I don't use Evernote to store most of my notes, because I don't need it
for managing plain text content. But I use Evernote to store a lot. I
usually put everything I do not work with now, or don't need now. But
all of the stuff I might need some day in there.

I know where all of my PDFs are. They are in Evernote. I know where all
of the scrapped blog post ideas are. They are in Evernote. I know where
all of the former writing projects are, they are in Evernote.

The way I use different systems to store different kinds of information
is very geeky. And I'm a geek. I think most people should use these
systems differently if they don't have a very good reason.

My own experience is that systems like Evernote makes it easier for most
people to know where their documents and notes are. They are able to
know where they need to look. And it's far less confusing than looking
through different folders on their Mac or PC.

Sync is hard. But with Evernote, you get it out of the box.

If you feel that your data is everywhere, and that you never are sure
about where things are on your hard drive. Give Evernote a change. Even
if you only use one notebook --- you know that everything is in there.
And it all of the tools for organizing and tagging are there if you find
out that you need it later on.

Getting your data out. The first time I needed to get all of my data out
of Evernote three years ago was a pain in the ass. It is far easier now.
You can export all attachments in one operation and it is just as easy
to get out the text of your notes, as HTML.

I have been going back and forth on Evernote over the years, and I have
come to the conclusion that everybody should have something like
Evernote in their tool belt. I use it as an archive, it makes it easy to
move things in and out. And I always know where to find old files. Like
today when I wanted to look at my English exam from this spring, it was
in Evernote.

But remember, no software solution will be able to organize your data,
this is something you need to do yourself.
