**Ben Brooks:**

> I hadn't touched my contexts inside of OmniFocus in, well, years.
> There was a ton of cruft in there stemming from various different
> techniques and ideas that I have tried over the years. Device based
> context, person based context, time based contexts, and location based
> contexts. For the better part of a year, all of my new tasks in
> OmniFocus simply went under the Mac context and --- well --- that's
> not really using the tool very well.

> But I struggled, because dicking around with my contexts is not
> productive, is tedious, and frankly it is quite annoying. More than
> any of that: I didn't have a single idea of what to change it to.
