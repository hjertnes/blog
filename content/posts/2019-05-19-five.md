Five year journals was something (I think) I first heard about on Patrick Rhone's old podcast Enough a very long time ago. Then I have looked at them many times over the years, but I first got serious about maybe getting one between 1,5 - 2 years ago. And about 2 months ago I finally ordered one. I got one from Leuchtturm1917 in the A5 format.

A five year journal is just a thick hardbound notebook with one page per day, with a date printed on the top and divided in five.

I'm really enjoying in this far, I have not skipped a day yet, and I kind of regret not getting one earlier. What I really look forward to now is to get past the first year so I can see what I wrote on this day last year.

You have some room, but not a lot of room each day, and that have made it easy to write something each morning. But I got to admit it, I freaked out a little bit when I realized that this is FIVE years. That is a really long. And I'm also wondering how well it will hold up that long.
