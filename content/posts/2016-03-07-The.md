  I want to start this review out right, with my honest opinion of how I like this ink. I hate it. Now let me tell you why I hate it and why you probably donâ€™t need this ink in your collection. I luckily only picked up a pack of cartridges to try out and avoided getting a bottle that would take up unnecessary space on my desk.
