I finally got arround to ordering a Nintendo Switch about a week ago,
and it is awesome. This is the first modern "handheld" Nintendo device I
have used that feel modern, both in terms of design and graphics. It is
great, but it feels more like an "iPad" than an "iPhone", unlike the
Nintendo 3DS. And I think I would have preffered something a tiny bit
smaller, because I mostly use it as a handheld device while communting
etc.
