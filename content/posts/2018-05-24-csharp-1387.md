There are times when the auto complete for C# and .NET Core stops
working in editors that use the OmniServer auto complete engine. For me
it is Emacs and Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code will give you a hint when it starts, while Emacs will
just fail. The problem is that they can't locate the "dotnet" command.
The place you need to start is that you start a Terminal with your shell
of choice and make sure that it works there. If it does type "which
dotnet" and copy the output.

Then you type sh and enter. Test it there, this is the place where it
should fail. There are two ways you can fix it, either by adding the
folder where the dotnet binary is located in to the path, or if you are
lazy like me by doing something like "ln -s
/usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin/dotnet".

And that should do the trick. As long as you can run the command
"dotnet" in sh it should be available anywhere.
