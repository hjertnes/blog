The Record is a interview show, focusing on Apple developers.

Brett Simmons have teamed up with Chris Parrish for the podcast The
Record. It is my absolute favourite "new" podcast for the time being.

Most podcasters these days record them over Skype, Google Hangouts or
something similar. The Record is one of the few podcasts out there where
they record it in the same room.

I think the dynamic and the whole feel of a podcast is different if it's
done in person, compared to doing it over Skype. Both of them can be
great.

Anyway. You should check out [The Record](http://therecord.co).
Especially if you are a developer that care about Apple history and love
great podcasts.
