I am in the process of trying to move a lot of my content from simple
blogposts into more of a collection of larger web-sites on my site. And
this introduces a lot of issues.

I really wish there was a good way to tell your rss subscribers that you
just updated some of your content, other than blog posts.

They way squarespace, wordpress and most related publishing platforms
are handling this is by not doing it. Which means you can do two things:
You can do Nothing, or making a blog-post that are informing your users
about it.

Both of them sucks. The former means that no-one knows about it, and the
later means that you are creating double the traffic; which is bad for
your advertisers etc.

We need some way to push updated content into RSS and twitter / app.net
publishing tools!
