I decided to get a pocket knife a way back. It turns out haivng a small knife with some other tools are very useful. The amount of time I don't have to stop what I was going to do to find a knife or some kind of tool have gone from most of the time to almost zero since I got this thing.

I decided to get a Climber from Victorinox. It is not **huge**, but still a little bit larger than what I would prefer. But the combination of features I wanted was not available on anything smaller.

After having had it for about six months, I'm mostly happy with it. But I might get something "more serious" like a Leatherman later. I have considered a few times. But the Climber covers most of my needs.
