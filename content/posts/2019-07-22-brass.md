I recently got a Ystudio fountain pen. It is a brass pen, and I love it.
Especially how cool it starts to look as the black paint starts to wear
off.

But there is something I really enjoy about it, and that is how the grip
section warms up when you use it for a longer periods.

I do think metal pens have some great properties that you simply don't
get with pens made out of plastic materials
