Finding a good notebook to use with your fountain pen can be difficult.

You can of course go for notebook with thick really observant paper. And I recommend that if you just starting out. But it doesn’t look that good. Here are my three favourites; they all handle fountain pens really well, and have relatively short dry time.

Travlelers notebook refill(the none tome river variant), Leuchtturm1917 and Rhodia. All of them are excellent. Which one you pick depends on your needs.

I use at least two of them at a daily basis. My journal is a Travelers Notebook, and I use two Leuchtturm1917 notebooks, one for tasks and one for long form writing.

The Travelers Notebook is great for a number of reasons, it is really compact and you can customise it after your needs. For example by combining blank and lined paper. And the narrow format makes it very easy to deal with slow drying inks(when you are left handed), it also makes it much easier to fit the notebook in a coat pocket or something than a regular A5 one.

Leuchtturm1917 has my favourite paper. It dries very fast, and almost never bleed through. And they also provide some nice details, like always at least two bookmarks and make a few special editions. Think of them as Moleskine with good paper.

Rhodia. I love their Webnotebooks. The book binding is the best feeling thing I have ever felt. I’m pretty sure it isn’t leather, but it feels like it, if not better. And the soft give of it gives it a very luxurious feeling. The dry time is a little bit longer than Leuchtturm1917, but not by far.

My personal go to is Leuchtturm1917 because of their multiple bookmarks. But I will from time to time get a Webbie for long form writing because they are so cool. And I would probably switch if they started to provide multiple markers.
