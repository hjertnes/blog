Fjellreven is a Swedish brand that is very popular here in Norway. We
have a lot of their products. I personally own two of them a Foldstack
No. 3 and Foldstack No. 3.

The No. 3 is one I have owned for a few yeras, it is the perfect bag
when I just want to bring a few things, like a camera, a notebook for
example.

Then after months of looking at different stuff, I finally ordered a new
bag at the end of last year. Because the stuff I carry have changed a
lot after I changed jobs. Before I carried my laptop, now I mainly carry
stuff to do while I commute. So I got a Foldstack No. 2

It is a large general purpose messenger style bag. Two water bottle
compartments on the outside, one on each side. A small compartment on
the outside and the main compartment is divided in three parts.

It works great for the stuff I carry. And I have still not filled it all
the way. I could probably fill it with more than I should carry in a
messenger style bag.
