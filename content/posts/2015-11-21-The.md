  At itâ€™s most basic, the COLORS subscription is a way for Field Notes fans to pay once a year to have the latest COLORS releases shipped to them as soon as the editions are released. Guaranteed, once a season, four times a year.

I have considered the Color Subscription many times, but the reason I never go for it is that I prefer the regular Field Notes, and I never know how often I need more notebooks. But I think it is a fantastic product to get, if you are the kind of person that buys every single edition anyways.
