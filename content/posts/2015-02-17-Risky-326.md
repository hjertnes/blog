David Sparks, of [Macsparky](http://macsparky.com) and the
[Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu) left his job, to run his own law
firm.

I've been a fan of David since I started to listen to podcasts again in
2011, and MPU was the third podcast I found. ANd I have been a regular
listener and reader since then.

He is also one of the few people that really have taken advantage of the
iBooks platform.

Read the fantastic post, subscribe to his podcast, and check out his
Field Guides.
