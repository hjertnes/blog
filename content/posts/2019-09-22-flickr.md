How to share photos is a common struggle for me. I want something that does not require a lot of work or management. I just want to give it a bunch of JPEGs and let it do its job. I have tried making my own thing, multiple times, I have tried to use Micro.blog. Nothing have been what I wanted.

I tried uploaded a few photos to Flickr, because [@jack](https://micro.blog/jack), and the process was fast effortless. So I decided to give it a shot and upgraded my account, before I exported my entire Photos library and see how well it works. And I'm pretty happy about it this far. But I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to share that I upload new photos.

Maybe I'll add the Flickr RSS feed, or maybe I'll just post link to an album when I upload new stuff. I'm not 100% sure yet.
