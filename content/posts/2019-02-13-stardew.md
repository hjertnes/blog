This was one of the first games I downloaded for my Switch. I think it
was the first day when I got it and I downloaded a few games.

It is a great game, and I do enjoy it a lot, but I don't love it. This
is the perfect game when you just want to kill some time. I have played
a lot of it on the train from and to work.

I think this is one of the games everyone with a Switch should get,
because it is not expensive, and you get a lot of entertainment out of
it.
