[Ustwo](http://ustwo.com) released an update to their amazing game:
[Monument Valley](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com), not long ago.
The game is amazing, and the $4 game, with the $2 iAP to get access to
new levels is worth it.

It always makes me sad when some people on the Internet start
complaining about having to pay for extra features or new versions.

It's okay to complain somewhere the company behind it can respond. This
is unfortunately impossible on the App Store. And we also see the same
"1 Star" problem every single time. The amazing thing that happened this
time was that a lot of people that love the game, and respect Ustwo went
on the App Store and responded with adding 5 star reviews; after they
tweeted about it.

Monument Valley is my all time favorite iOS game, and you should go and
get it.
