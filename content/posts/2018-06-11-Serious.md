I'm seriously considering going to back to Pilot Iroshizuku inks. There
is just something about them that I loved.

-   The shorter dry time
-   How smooth the inks are
-   How awesome the bottles are.

There are nothing wrong with Diamine or the other inks I have used
lately. But they are not up there with Iroshizuku. Not as smooth, takes
a little bit longer to dry. It really adds up over time.
