I'm not even bothering to link to it, but Amazon is either planning to,
or rolling out some kind of subscription service for Kindle. The basic
idea is that you can download as many books you want from a limited
collection of titles. Kind of like Spotify; the only exception being
that Spotify have a great catalogue.

I remember reading about it a few weeks ago, but I didn't have much to
say about it. Now, I do.

I don't think this is a good idea, and I doubt it will go anywhere.

Amazon owns one of my favourite platforms, Audible. Why didn't they just
copy their subscription model? I love it. You subscribe to either a Gold
or Platinum membership. And you pay a flat fee, to download either one
or two audiobooks per month.

I doubt most people read more than one or two books a month, but some
people do. The great thing about a subscription to Audible is that you
also buy any book in their store for a lower price.

This is what I think Amazon should have done. Books aren't like music.
