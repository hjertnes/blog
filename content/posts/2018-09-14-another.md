I looked at my insane pile of notebooks a while back, and decided to
just throw the damn pile in the trash. But then some great people at
Micro.blog convinced me to keep parts of it.

So, I went through them all and decided to keep everything that
contained stuff I have written. But I decided to get rid of everything
that was lists, tasks, notes etc. The result was that most of it are
gone. I think the result was that 2/3 of my notebooks are gone. And most
of the new ones I fill up are thrown out as soon as I am done with them.

This have done a lot to make my netbook collection more manageable, and
limited to what might be interesting at some point.
