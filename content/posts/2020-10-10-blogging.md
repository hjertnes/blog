I have updated the design today. Stole some stuff from Eli and made it my own.

My [wiki](https://hjertnes.wiki) is down at the moment. Or not down, but there isn't a lot there. The reason is that I had that thing, and then I migrated it to <https://roamresearch.com/> and then that became <https://orgroam.com/> and I have no working way to publish that in a good way. So my wiki is just for me at the moment.

There are some changes to org-roam in the upcoming version that might make it easier to manage.

So I might post more here. Until then.

Stole some of the awesome colours from [Eli](https://eli.li).
