This is just a short list of what a A5 notebook should be like in order to be the most useful to me
```

<ul>

```text
<li>

  Lined or grid

</li>

<li>

  I prefer lined for long form writing and dot grid for tasks.

</li>

<li>

  Hardcover; because it is much more convenient when I write somewhere I donâ€™t have a flat surface available.

</li>

<li>

  At least two markers

</li>

<li>

  I prefer three

</li>

<li>

  The paper should be good; Leuchtturm1917 or Rhodia quality is the standard I expect.

</li>

<li>

  And then I mean both paper quality and shorter dry time.
