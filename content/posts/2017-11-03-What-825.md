Babel started out as a project called 5to6. It is a tool chain to
transpile Javascript code. You can for example use Javascript syntax
that isn't even included in the standard yet and transpile it over to
code that will work in the browsers you need it to work. It is modular,
and easy to configure in most build system. I mainly use it through
webpack. But you can also use it together with node.
