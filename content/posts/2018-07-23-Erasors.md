Some pencils come with erasers on top, while others don't. I would
personally prefer to not have them there at all, because I just pull
them off and sharpen both sides of the pencil. But for those who use
them: is it that difficult to make a pencil with one that actually
works?

Fine I get it that you have to cut some corners if you make cheap
pencils, but when we pay around $2 per pencil I think we should be able
to expect the fucking thing to work.
