The latest version of Lightroom CC brings the file management features I
was missing; it allows you to tell it to specify a location to store all
of your originals that don't count against the cache storage limit. In
other words; it also brings a setting to store all smart previews
locally. I think Lightroom CC is slowly turning into a much better
version of Lightroom Classic.
