I can't promise anything, but I think this will be the last one about
home screens I'm a while.

One of the requirements I set for apps on my home screen is that I
launch them every day. Or at least five days a week. In other words,
every day I'm doing something more productive than listening to podcasts
or audio books.

My home screen is usually not full. And I do this for a very important
reason. Few apps there, makes it easier to find the app I need.

Give it a try. It makes my day to day life much easier. And I think it
could make yours simpler too.
