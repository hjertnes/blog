I can’t believe that it is April already. This is another month with just some minor changes to what I carry, plus a bigger one that isn’t related to stationary.

What I have done is that I have re-introduced a A4 notebook into my rotation. It isn’t something I carry everywhere or anywhere. It just stays on my desk. I’m going to get more into that in an upcoming post.

I also have simplified the pens I bring with me everywhere. I have dedicated my TWSBI 580AL as my “on the go” pen, and that is the only pen I bring with me. While my Lamy 2000 is my go to long form writing pen at home. And the rest are using for writing down notes where and there. I’m also going more into this in an upcoming blog post.

Other than that, I still use the Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo in all of my pens, and almost all of my notebook needs are still centred around my Midori Travelers Notebook.

The big change to what I carry everywhere is that I finally pulled the trigger on a camera I have considered to buy for a very long time. Photography is one of my favourite hobbies, and I have been looking for a good camera that is more portable than my Canon, but more enjoyable to use than my iPhone. I bought myself a Fujifilm X100t.

As I said last month, the goal is to have pictures with more or less every single blog post I’m publishing from now on. The exception is my weekly link post.
