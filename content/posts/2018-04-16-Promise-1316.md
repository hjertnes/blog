We finally have a finally method on promises.

Previously we had the .then and .catch methods on promises, you deal
with a success in the .then and errors in .catch. But often you have
some code you want to run no matter if it is a success or not. Finally
solves this exact problem. For example if you want to hide a loading UI
element or something no matter if it was a success or not.
