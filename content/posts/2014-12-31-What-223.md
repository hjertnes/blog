I love my AeroPress, I have two of them. They are cheap, easy to use and
make very good coffee. They are also very easy to clean. The funny thing
about this simple plastic device is that it often make better coffee
than expensive espresso machines I have tried. My advice to people that
want to get into coffee is always to get a AeroPress, a good grinder and
Chemex. Some people want to make espresso, while others want something
closer to pour over. Both of them make excellent coffee.
