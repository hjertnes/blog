Stub nibs are not my favourite thing in the world. They are kind of
scratchy if you don't hold them in the right angle, and other nibs like
my medium or broad's are way smoother. But it looks so cool.

The way I use pens is that I have all the pens I own and enjoy inked up
and I just cycle through them, and move over to the next one when my
current one runs out of ink. And I have a system for cleaning them every
other refill or something like that.

Most of them are in rotation because I love writing with them. The one
exception is my TWSBI Eco with a Stub nib. I don't hate writing with it,
but I prefer every other pen in rotation over it. The main reason I keep
it in rotation is how cool my writing looks with a sub nib compared to
everything else I own.
