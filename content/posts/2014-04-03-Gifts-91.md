Birthday and christmas presents is one of the things I always struggle
with. I don't give presents to many people, only the few I care about. I
give my family albums, of the pictures I have taken during the last
year.

Albums are great. People remember them, they are not that expensive, and
they mean a lot. Both for the receiver and the creator.

I have also started doing something new.

My book collection is huge. And I have read most of my books, at least
once. I started doing something new. There are a small group of people I
care enough about to give them real presents. There are of course a lot
of other people are care about. But these are people that are kind of
like me. They like books.

What I have started doing is to write a few words to them in one of my
favourite books, that I think they would and just give it to them.

I love books, I love reading them, and I have started to love giving
them away, to people I care about.

You can always find a new copy, if you want to read it again.

There is two exceptions to this rule. Books I have received from other
people as a present. And books I have inherited. I can't give them away.

_Find someone you love, find a book that you think that person would
love as you love, and give it to them._
