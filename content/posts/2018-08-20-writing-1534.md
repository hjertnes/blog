The way I write is that it starts with some idea. I usually write it
down either in Drafts or in a Field Notes, that eventually finds its way
into Omni Focus. Then I write a draft in a lined Leuchtturm1917
notebook. Usually either with a pencil or a fountain pen.

The next step is that I go through all the stuff I have written there
every 25 pages or so. I transcribe the stuff I am happy with on my
AlphaSmart Neo or re-add the idea to Omni Focus if I want to try it
again.

Then I start BBEdit, open my Drafts.txt document and send the text from
my AlphaSmart when I'm done.

The next step is that I once a week schedule posts for this site and The
Ink Smudge. I pick the stuff I like from the Drafts document and I also
try to delete stuff that I know I'm never going to publish.
