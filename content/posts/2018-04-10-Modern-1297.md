We are on the second generation of iPhones without a headphone jack. And
I guess most people are moving towards bluetooth at this point. But you
get a lightning to jack plug in the box.

I think bluetooth is better in many ways. Especially when you listen on
the go or while walking around somewhere. No cables that get hooked on
door handles etc. But the big problem when you are using the EarPods
included with the iPhone is that you can't charge them while listening
to something.

If Apple want the user experience to be as good as it was when we had a
dedicated port, they either have to include a double that supports both
charging and listening or they need to include AirPods with every
iPhone.
