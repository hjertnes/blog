One of the awesome bonuses of moving my Emacs config system of choice
from Spacemacs to Doom is that how I sync my configuration between
systems are much simpler. Because of the difference in where your
additions or modifications live in relation to the rest of the code.

In Spacemacs you have a config file: .spacemacs and then you have all
the Spacemacs code in .emacs.d and a folder called "private" in the
layer folder in .emacs.d where you add your stuff. Doom on the other
hand (on the develop branch) has all its code in .emacs.d and all your
stuff in .doom.d. What makes the doom.d folder interesting is that in
its init file is where you control what modules to load, but it is also
a module of itself. Which menas that you can treat it as your private
modules that adds all the extra packages you want and all your
configuration.

The great thing about this is that when you want to update or re-install
your emacs setup on a machine, all you have to do is to is to clone Doom
Emacs and clone / copy your doom.d folder. Instead of how you had to do
it with spacemacs
