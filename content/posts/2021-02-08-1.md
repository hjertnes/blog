Gave up on WandaVision. We tried to watch it three times? I might get back to it at some later point. 

I have no problem with watching at least a handfull of shows I don't like that much, before I give up on it. But my better half usually isn't into that; So we gave up after 1.5 episode. 

It was just very weird.
