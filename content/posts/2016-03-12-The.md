  How I use my notebooks is something I think about a lot. In July 2015 I wrote a post on my notebook set-up exploring what notebooks I used and more importantly how I used them. However since July quite a bit has changed therefore I wanted to post a February 2016 update running through my notebook usage.

I love reading about how people use their notebooks, this post both gave me some ideas about how to use my notebooks, and also some changes to my monthly load out post.
