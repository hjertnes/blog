> With Jekyll 3.0, I want to take Jekyll back to its roots: simplicity,
> extensibility, and speed.

I love Jekyll. And I think some of the new stuff that comes in Jekyll 3
is cool. For example, generating new posts with a simple command.

But the thing I love the most about Jekyll, is how simple it is to work
with it. It is one of the few systems where I can do real work without
internet. That makes it ideal for when you work with a spotty, or
without a connection.

A file based system like Jekyll is great for generating web sites. Like
I said, you can work with it, without a internet connection. You don't
even need a complicated setup for development or production. It also
means you don't need a big VPS to host it; any web server can serve
static web pages.

The speed of the site is one thing. But the thing I like even better is
that I don't need to fiddle with a web-interface or app. I can just
write in Sublime Text, and use git to update my site.

Let's get back to 3.0; they are fixing a lot of issues in the upcoming
3.0 release. They are making it easier to create new blog posts, and
that is good. Jekyll is not for everyone, but I think it will be
something for even more people in the new release.
