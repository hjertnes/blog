**The Sweet Setup:**

> Of all the cases we put to the test, Apple's own Silicone Case
> provided the best combination of form, function, and ease of use.

I got a red Apple silicone case together with my 6s Plus, and it is a
fantastic case. It is a great case, and the best case I have used with
any iPhone. My only issue is it is a pain to get it in and out of the
pocket in my jeans.
