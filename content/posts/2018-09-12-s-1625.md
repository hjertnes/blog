Tags. We finally have tags.

I never really got perspectives, and contexts in OF 1 and 2. Or I
understood them, but I never found a way to use them together in a
prodctive way that made sense to me.

It took me a minute to get into perspectives with OF3.

My favourite thing about how tags are implemented though, is that you
can use them like me as a flat structure, or like people used contexts
in the past.
