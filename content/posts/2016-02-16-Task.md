```text
I just added a new page to the site. One of the things I wanted to do when I started this site was to put some time into explaining how I use pen and paper to manage my day to day life. You can find the first version of it <a href="/gtd">here</a>. I decided to have it as a page instead of a blog post because I’m going to update it from time to time.

```text
It is a rough first draft. it will be updated from time to time, both in terms of content as my system and tools change, and in terms of some much needed editing.

I’m also going to set up a Public Github Repo to have easy access to the different versions of the text.
