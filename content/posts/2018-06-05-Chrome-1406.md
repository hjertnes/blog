So, I have changed all my daily browsing activities over from Chrome to
Firefox, because I think it is just much faster. But I still use Chrome
for some stuff: 1Password X on Linux and web development. The reason I
still use Chrome for web development is not because the dev tools are
better, but because I like them better. Part of it is probably because I
have used them since 2009, and know them in and out. And because I
prefer having them on the right side of the screen instead of the
bottom, the Chrome dev tools are much more adaptive to how wide they are
than the Firefox are. It will probably be better and the future. But I'm
going to stick to Chrome for web development.

This is very important actually. If web developers are using browser X
for development, because they think the tools are better, then that app
will probably work better there, because the developers spend more time
using their web app there.
