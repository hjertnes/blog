My iPhone 8 Plus still feels very new and fast, after about a year of
use. That got to be the first time. In the past I have told myself that
I don't need a new phone. This time I'm not that interested in the new
stuff.

When I looked at the X, Xs, Xs Max and the Xr I thought: this is kind of
like with the MacBook Air when Apple kept it up to date. I could get the
fancy "Pro" model, but the cheapest is probably good enough. In other
words, I'd probably get a new 8 Plus if this one broke.
