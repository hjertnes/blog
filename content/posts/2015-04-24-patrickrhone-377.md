**Patrick Rhone:**

> My Grandmother was a piano teacher. She was also a world renowned
> concert pianist. She was awarded her Ph.D. in Piano Performance from
> the University of Iowa. She was also a freedom fighter, quite active
> in the civil rights movement in the south. She was also the author of
> three books about the life of a blind pianist named Blind Tom Wiggins.
> She was on the Board of Trusties at Dillard University for many years.
> She was a college professor at the University of Minnesota for about
> thirty years and Chair of her department for ten of those.

My life have been a combination of luck, and just doing what excited me.
And I hope I can continue to do that for the rest of my life. I believe
that it is important to do things you can be proud of. That is one of
the reasons I moved from Stavanger in 2012, I was sick of doing work for
companies that worked for the Oil & Gass sector.

Do the kind of things you can be proud of.
