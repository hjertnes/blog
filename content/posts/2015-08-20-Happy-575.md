I meant to have something ready for the day, but that didn't happen.
Anyways. Here it is.

It is amazing to see what Myke and Stephen have done in just one tiny
year. Relay have moved from a brand new podcasting network with some of
my favourite shows, to my favourite network.

I have been listening to Myke Hurley for a long time. The first podcast
I started listening to was Enough, which is still my all time favourite
podcast. I'm not 100% sure about the time. But it was either right
before he started 70 Decibels, or right after.

Everyone should check out Myke's podcasts, and the rest of the
[Relay.fm](http://relay.fm) shows. There are something there for
everyone.

Congratulations on the first year!
