I'm not a huge fan of how Amazon are doing at the moment. While I do
agree that ebooks should be cheap.

Here is the thing. I talked to a Norwegian author a few years ago, and
he told me that the six months where the hardcover book have the
monopoly is the time when he makes his living. And that is important.

I don't have any problem with either waiting six months for the
paperback or the ebook, or paying a premium on the ebook until the
paperback is out.

Writing books are hard. And we need sustainable pricing models to make
sure both the authors and publishing industry can make a living.
