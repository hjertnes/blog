Yesterday was the day where I finally went and started to play around
wth [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/). I find it hard to
describe it, but it's one amazing piece of software. I would not call it
[MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) for iPad. But, I
would rather call it the first programmable text editor for iOS. And
maybe the first one that get these things right; and yes, I would love
to have it on my Mac.

The thing I really love about editorial compared to both
[MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) and
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) is that it does not have build in
support for anything, other than dropbox syncing, a browser, and some
basic markdown tools, and some other basic stuff. But what you have is a
very easy to use framework for build workflows, that can do more or less
anything, that you would like a editor like
[Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) to do.

One of the things I really love about this thing is how easy it was for
me to set it up to email new posts to this Squarespace 6 blog, only in a
few clicks No copy and paste; just two clicks!

If you use squarespace, and want to do the same thing, check out
[this](http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/4970737450352640/GER0aYUXXaU)
workflow. The only thing you have to do is to find your squarespace blog
email address and paste it into the workflow. You can see how to enable
and find your squarespace email address
[here](http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/754734-can-i-post-to-my-blog-via-email-).

I think Editorial is the first product where things is way batter on iOS
than anything you can find for OS X.
