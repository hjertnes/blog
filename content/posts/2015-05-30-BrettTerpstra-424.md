Fantastic, I'll be upgrading as soon as I get around to it.

The new features I look forward to is:

-   Snippet suggestions

-   Search for snippests inline

I have used TextExpander for a long time, and every new version have
been great. But I think version 5 is the first release where it feels
like they are adding the kind of things that makes it possible for
"regular users" to get into it.
