Welcome to The Ink Smudge. This is a site about Stationary, and more specifically about finding the best tools and the best way to use them. I used to write about this every now and then on my <a href="http://hjertnes.me">personal site</a>, but I never was a fit with the rest of the content. So I decided a few months ago to spin it off, and to create a site just for this stuff.

The great thing about that is that Iâ€™m going to write a lot more about it than before. I have a lot of great stuff lined up, or I do at least think it is great. And a lot more stuff on my to-do list.
