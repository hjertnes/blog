Most of my new years intentions is something I keep to myself, mainly
because I don't think they are not that interesting to anyone except for
myself. But, I decided to make one of them public, just this moment;
while making some coffee.

My creative process is based around some idea. Like this one. And then I
either just write it down, either as a title, or a few paragraphs.
Sometimes I write the article right away, while other times I leave it
there, and write it later.

When it comes to the writing part, there are the texts that it is very
easy to write. The article ends up with a nice flow and I feel like the
thing I wanted to say is clear. In other words, it was easy, and the
result is something I am proud of.

While other times the writing of something is very hard. I have to write
them many times. And some times I never end up with something that I
want to put my name on. One of my intentions for 2014 is to work hard to
make sure that as many as possible of the good ideas, no matter if they
are hard or easy makes it out there.
