When I got into pencils (a few hours later) I started to look into a
pencil case of some sort. It seems like most go for a roll of some sort,
with induvidual slots for each pencil or a puch where you can stick how
many you wish.

Then you have a lot of leather, or either very cheap or expensive
non-leather materials.

My first thought after trying to navigate this is that this is exactly
how it was with pen cases before Nock Co.

So, I just found a cheap pen case at home, you know the kind you used
when you went to High School. And used that until I found something that
matched my criteria

-   Not leather
-   Not overpriced
-   Not cheap.

Then Nock Co made a pencil case. And I love this thing. It is very
inexpensive, $15 (Blackwing makes something similar for $35), and the
quality is the same as all other Nock.co products.

It is simple, and exactly what I want.
