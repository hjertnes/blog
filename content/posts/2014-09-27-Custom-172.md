I started writing a longer piece about custom keyboards in iOS 8. Before
I realised that I could cut it down to the basics.

Custom keyboards in iOS 8 is amazing, we finally have a TextExpander
that have the same universal power, as the OS X counterpart.

We also have something that might be even cooler as we move forward.
Custom keyboards will enable developers to make new and improved ways to
input text on iOS; like what Swype are doing, by just "swiping" the
word, instead of typing. Or what SwiftKey are doing with the best
prediction engine I have ever seen.

The default keyboard have also gotten a facelift, with a prediction
engine, instead of autocorrect.

I'm Norwegian, and most of the good keyboards available for iOS don't
support it. My iOS typing is 50/50 English and Norwegian. So, I have to
stick with the default one, for now.

I'm going to keep my eye on both SwiftKey and Swype in the coming weeks
and months. And I really hope either one or both get support for
Norwegian.
