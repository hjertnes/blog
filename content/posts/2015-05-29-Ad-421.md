I think Ad blockers should be legal. The problem isn't ad blockers, the
problem is bad ads. No, not bad -- terrible.

The problem is not ads themselves, but the fact that they drive users to
install ad blockers. We get free stuff, and the ads are paying for that.
Fine. That's the deal. But ad companies and site owners need to get
better at creating the kind of ad campaigns that don't drive us nuts.
The kind where you want to click on the ad.
