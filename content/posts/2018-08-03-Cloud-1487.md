I have never written anything of substance for any of the server-less
stuff that amazon or microsoft are doing. Or I have used some of the
services here and there, but I have never gone "all the way".

One of the reasons I have never gone in on any of them is that all the
stuff are proprietary. If I want to move I have to re-write a
significant amount of code. And it also requires a lot of manual
configuration for it to work.

What I would like to see is standards. Or at least a standard compliant
way to use them. Because a lot of the features exist across the various
services; old shit, new wrapping.

I don't care that much about how, but what I want is some kind of
configuration or manifest file plus some code that I can deploy.

Just to tell it what kind of services I need, how I want them to be
configured etc.

And if I want to change from Amazon to Microsoft it would just be to
update DNS and upload the shit.

Also, if this was done, it would also be possible to run your own
version of it, and get some real developer environments locally.
