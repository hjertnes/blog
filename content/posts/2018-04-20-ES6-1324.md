[ES6
Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global%5FObjects/Proxy) are awesome. I have not used them much "in the wild" yet. But
I think they add some very interesting concepts to JavaScript. You are
kind of familiar with them if you have worked with Properties in C#,
Java, Swift or Objective-C. The short version is that you define a
method that is called when you try to retrieve a value or setting a
value. But instead of calling .methodToGetMyValue is it called when you
try to access some value.

The biggest difference between the JavaScript Proxies and setter /
getters is that you define them for a "variable"(in lack of a better
word for it). That means that you could define it for an entire list or
object or just a value.
