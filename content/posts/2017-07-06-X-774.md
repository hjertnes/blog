There are no technical reason for shooting in manual in most situations these days. But I love shooting with mechanical analog cameras, and I also enjoy shooting in full manual on other cameras that are designed to do so.

The Fuji X-Pro 2 is without doubt a very good option for this.

I think it is a healthy training exercise for photographers to shoot manually from time to time, in order to really understand how the different parameters work.

The experience of shooting in full manual mode on a DSLR like my Canon 650D was a horrible experience, because you don’t have a histogram in the viewfinder and because you don’t have physical controls and because there are no tools to help you focus. It takes forever and isn’t fun.

Doing it with the X-Pro is fun. Just turn on the histogram, twist the ISO, Shutter and Aperture unit the histogram give you the proper feedback, and then you just focus and shoot.

The reason it is so much better, in my opinion is that you can adjust all of it without looking away from the view finder, and because Fuji cameras give you zooms into the focus point makes it very easy to focus correctly.
