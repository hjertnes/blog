  When I first saw shots of the Lamy Imporium, I was mesmerized. I loved the guilloche patterns, the clean lines of the cap, and the nib–oh, that nib! The black exterior with the gold center was just too cool. Then I saw the price. $520 for a Lamy? No way. Plus, initially I was told the pen wouldn’t be sold in the US (that turned out to be incorrect). I quietly resigned myself to no Lamy Imporium.

I’m usually not into anything gold, if you get what I mean, but the Imporium looks very good. I think Lamy pens are the best, and I really love how their nibs feel and how they look; especially the high end models.

But I don’t get why they can’t make a cheap pen like the Safari without that ridiculous moulded grip section.
