I spend a lot of time on this site trying to convince people that
immutable data structures are the way to go. They might be a little bit
more difficult from time to time, and a little bit slower; but I believe
it is worth it because when you use immutable techniques instead of
mutable you know that you need to actually tell your code "replace this
with this" for something to change. And I believe it is a good way to
avoid a lot of annoying bugs.

The standard way to add a element to a array in Javascript is using the
push method like below:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/46adfe7923bff178d4ef959941860f3c.js>"></script>

</div>

Or you could do it with concat, which is the way I prefer to do it:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/d6165e1c9bffb1a1029f015f9a02dc7c.js>"></script>

</div>

The result is the same, but with the latter you can do what ever you
want with the list, without worrying about fucking up the original,
before you explicitly tell it to be replaced.
