So, I use Windows at work. It is not horrible, but I still hate it. I
was looking for a mouse to have at home, just in case I had to work from
home or something.

As I was looking I I realized that most of the options either was the
same cheap Logitec thing I had at work, or something fancy with a
million buttons or one of the two or three options that was good for my
hand.

I decided to either get the cheapest possible or something that was good
for my hands.

I decided to get this one from Microsoft because the other ergonomic one
was from Logitec (you know the huge mouse with the big ball on it)
almost three times as expensive.

This mouse is like a big flat ball. It is so large that you can rest
your entire hand on top of it, instead of having to use moucles to hold
up your hand. It is really comfortable to use, and I like it a lot.

I like it so much that I took the one I got to work and ordered a second
one.
