The typical post WWDC journalism is here. And I'm already sick of it.

Every year at this time, when all the journalists and reporters are
getting down from the "Everything Apple annonced"-high. Then they start
talking about all of the major and minor things that Apple didn't
improve.

Here is the thing. Apple can't do everything. And I prefer an Apple that
gives us a handfull of solid improvements, or something in that
ballpark. To an Apple that gives us a boatload of buggy, and far from
perfect stuff.

This is Apple, not Google. Deal with it.
