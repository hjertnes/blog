Okay, I'm trying to move over to [Duck Duck Go][0] for the third time,
in as many years. I don't use that many Google Services, and I only use
them if I have to. They don't provide many services that I absolutely
need. The exceptions right now, is Google Analytics, and Search.

I'm trying to replace Google Search for Duck Duck Go at the moment. The
reason it didn't work the last few times I tried, was bad support for
Duck Duck Go in Safari on iOS and OS X. They have also redesigned the
web site.

This is what I'm going to do. Duck Duck Go is going to be my go to
search engine for at least a month. And I'm switching back if it doesn't
feel right after that.

Google Analytics is another thing. I'm not 100% sure what to do.
Analytics is one of the things I'm not 100% sure if I want to pay for at
the moment. And Google Analytics is good enough right now. But I'm going
to do one thing this year. To figure out if it is something I'm going to
continue with, and if I am, then I need a plan to move it away from
Google.

This might be the year I move everything, except for the few people I
talk on Google Talk with, and the few people I know that use Google
Docs.
