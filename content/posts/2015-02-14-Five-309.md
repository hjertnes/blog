[Marco](http://www.marco.org), [John](http://hypercritical.co) and
[Casey](http://www.caseyliss.com) talked about the new Photos.app in
the [latest](http://atp.fm/episodes/104) episode of
[ATP](http://atp.fm); and I just had to write this thing: five things
I love about Lightroom

1.  Lightroom is a priority to Adobe, they move fast, and even the beta
    versions are solid.

2.  Lightroom wasn't that expensive before
    [Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html); and
    isn't today; you can get a subscription to Lightroom + Photoshop for
    $10 a month.

3.  Lightroom lets me figure out what to keep or not faster than anything
    else I have tried. They have a selection called "last import", and
    you can just browse through it with the arrow keys, and press the "x"
    button on every photo you want to delete. And just find "Delete
    rejected photos" in the Library menu after you're done.

4.  It's easy to do the simple things I do; and I can move into more
    advanced things if I want to; and the recourses to learn that is
    available everywhere.

5.  A library in Lightroom is a folder that contains a three things: your
    library file; backups of the library; and a folder structure for you
    pictures. This means that the files themselves are there; they aren't
    hidden in a package file or anything.

To round things up a little, Lightroom is great for anyone with either a
lot of pictures, a DSLR, or someone that want something more advanced
than iPhoto. The reasons I went for Lightroom a few years ago was
because they kept it up to date, and the stuff I do after every time I
take pictures is very efficient.

A full 16GB SD card of raw files from my camera; 500 -- 600 pictures;
takes 15-20 minutes to process, including importing & converting to
DNG1; the same process took 2 times as long with Aperture or iPhoto.

I would test out both Photos.app and Lightroom when the time comes to
pick a new photo management app.

DNG is Adobe's "raw" format; they can convert all the different kinds of
raw files into DNG during import. ↩
