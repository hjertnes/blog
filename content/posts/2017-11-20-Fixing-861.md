I was coding some Chicken Scheme during the weekend and had some serious
problems getting OpenSSL to work properly. This is probably the first
time I've had to compile anything from source by hand in years.

The problem was that most of the stuff I use from day to day have
migrated to use LibreSSL on OS X, while the Chicken Scheme eggs I was
using hasn't. Apple have moved over to Libre, and Homebrew have stopped
to let me link OpenSSL, because of compability reasons. Or I do at least
assume so.

I followed the steps on this StackOverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38670295/homebrew-refusing-to-link-openssl>
thread to fix it

cd /usr/local/src

Run this if it doesn't exist:

cd /usr/local && mkdir src && chown USER src && cd src

curl --remote-name
<https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2h.tar.gz>

tar -xzvf openssl-1.0.2h.tar.gz

cd openssl-1.0.2h

./configure darwin64-x86\_64-cc --prefix=/usr/local/openssl-1.0.2h shared

make depend

make

sudo make install

ln -s /usr/local/openssl-1.0.2h/bin/openssl /usr/local/bin/openssl

And, if you need to install the openssl egg (or any other SSL lib) run
the following commands:

export CPATH=$CPATH:/usr/local/src/openssl-1.0.2h/include

export LIBRARY\_PATH=$LIBRARY\_PATH:/usr/local/src/openssl-1.0.2h/lib

chicken-install openssl
