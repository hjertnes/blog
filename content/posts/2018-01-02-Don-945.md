Session storage is a key value store in the browser, that can be used
for temporary storage in JavaScript apps, per tab / window / session. It
used to be a very useful technique in the "old" days. I have seen some
people use it instead of redux or react's built in state for some strage
reason. And I think it is a bad anti-pattern. Because of various per
browsers limitations, and you miss all of the nice things about redux /
react state.

If you think you need it, I would look into why. Because if to make it
easier to pass data between components, then I would look into redux.
