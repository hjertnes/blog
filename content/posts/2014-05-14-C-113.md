The importance of core business. Dropbox was a great service, they
solved a big problem, syncing more or less flawlessly for a long time.
But I have noticed that the OS X client have become more and more
unreliable the last 12-18 months.

First of all, it's slower. The speed wasn't a problem in the old days,
and it isn't really a problem now; but I notice that the speed is worse.

The frustrating problem is that the client started to crash every now
and then sometime the last year. And now it's not my machine, this is
just one of three Mac's that I have experienced crashes.

The big problem is that the whole idea of dropbox isn't running on my
mac isn't there. I have internet, and my Macbook Air are running -- of
course dropbox is syncing.

And then it goes a few weeks, and you realise it wasn't running; and you
need to fix 300 conflicted files in your nvALT folder.

My issue isn't that Dropbox is slower, or that the client is buggier. My
problem is that this are happening at the same moment that they are
introducing a whole lot of new crap. That I don't need or want. At the
expense of the core service that made Dropbox famous.

We have the "Skype"-problem all over again.

Nothing annoys me more than to se a great service going to shit because
of a lot of fancy crap their loyal and core audience don't want.
