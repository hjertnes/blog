We can all agree that two factor authentication is a good idea, and that it in general improves security a great deal. But it also needs to be easy enough in order to ensure that people adopt it.

I tired adopting to it two years or go using <a href="https://authy.com">Authy</a>, but I ended up going back to “one factor authentication” because it was too much of a hassle to deal with.

Then I decided to finally get started and try it again a few days ago. This time I decided to try <a href="http://onepassword.com">1Passwords</a> solution. I know it is probably not the best idea to have passwords, emergency two factor codes and the two factor codes in the same place, but my biggest worry isn’t if someone gets access to my 1Password database (then I’m totally screwed no matter what), it is if someone gets access to a password.

As stated above, the 1Password solution might not be the most secure, but having access to copying the codes both on my iPhone and my MacBook is convenient enough for me to actually use it.

My approach to security have never been about finding the perfect most secure solution, but rather to slowly becoming more secure every single month.
