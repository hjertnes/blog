I think I was pretty clear about the fact that I think redux is awesome,
and that I don't like MobX very much. But I do recommend that you take a
serious look at both before you make up your mind. Because I think it is
a good idea to make sure that as much as possible of your application
code lives outside your UI Library / Framework. I say this because it
makes it much easier to work with and it also makes it easier to switch
away from React in the future.

Which one you chose should come down to your and your teams preferences
and your projects requirements. My view is -- preferences set aside --
that MobX means less code, which is good -- and that redux gives you
much more control of where and how state flows through your application.
The latter can be a huge performance win, while the former can be a huge
productivity win.
