I started jstips.blog in November(I think) to challenge myself to write
a lot about JavaScript. But I started to get frustrated with the limits
I put on myself. So I had the choice between either extending the scope
of the site to development in general or to merge it with this site. I
went with the latter. But I'm going to continue with the main challenge
I put on myself. I'm going to post something every single day.
