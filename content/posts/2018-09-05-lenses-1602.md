-8mm For when I want to capture it all -23mm For snapshots and
landscapes -35mm More or less the same as the 23, only that I want a
little bit more control of bokeh or what is in the frame -50mm For
portraits.

I love my lenses, and the output I get from them. But I think I want to
get a zoom, especially for traveling. The problem is that zooms are kind
of heavy, but it is a pain to change primes a lot.

So, I guess I will get one. The one I like the best of the for sale
lenses for Fuji is the 18-135mm.
