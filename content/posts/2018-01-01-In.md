I haven't written about what I use and carry in a long time now.

The pens I carry change from week to week, but what I have with me today
is my Pilot Vanishing Point, TWSBI Eco Stub and TWSBI Eco Broad. And I
have my trusted Travelers Notebook with two lined refill, one Nock.co
pocket sized notebook. And two Leuchtturm1917 A5 notebooks; one lined
for writing and one dot grid for tasks and stuff.

My current ink is Diamine Sargasso Sea.

I'm mostly happy with my setup at the moment. There aren't much I
change, except for my ink every few months. But I do wish Leuchtturm1917
would expand the available colours available for their various
notebooks. Because I would like to have different colours for the two
notebooks I carry.
