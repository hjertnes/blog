Installing SilverFast always drives me nuts. The installation process is
designed as bad as the software itself. Download a new copy (because the
one included with the scanner is outdated). Make sure the scanner is
connected to the computer. Then type in a long serial number, before you
need to insert the original installation media for it to verify that you
actually have the original CD or DVD.

It requires two USB-A to USB-C adapters plus a USB CD Drive to install
the damn thing on a modern MacBook Pro.
