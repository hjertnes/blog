During easter of 2018, I decided to delete all my Facebook accounts, and so I did. After reaching out and finding other ways to keep in touch with the very few people from there I cared to keep in touch with. Then I continued to get rid of all the Google stuff in my life after that. I still have my Email account, but it have been forwarding all e-mail like it have for 6 years or something.

If you want to get ditch Google and Facebook it will be hard. Some stuff you simply can't participate in. Other times you need to accept that you have less choice or that you need to use a worse solution.

At this point, you really need to want to do so to succeed. At least once a week since I ditched them, there have been a situation where the easy and convenient solution would have been to go back in.

I wish it was easier and less of a sacrifice to do so. We are not there yet, but I think the only way to get there is to stick with it and hope for to become easier.
