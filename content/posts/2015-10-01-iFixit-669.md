I have seen a lot of stupid comments from people I respect about this.
Look above, iFixit are writing the following: "We weighed the risks,
blithely tossed those risks over our shoulder". In other words: they
knew this might happen, but they didn't give a fuck. But Gruber's
[comments](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/30/evidently) was
fantastic, and as (almost) always spot on.

There are a number of issues regarding this issue.

-   Apple should have known that iFixit would do this

-   Should they just pick the recievers at random, or pick developers that
    intend to develop tvOS apps?

-   Should Apple exclude developers like iFixit?

I think everything went as they should have, and as we should expect
them to. Apple should just send out developer units to randomly selected
people, and they should throw out developers that don't respect the NDA;
iFixit should do what is in their DNA, but maybe they should wait to
tear down devices until they are available for the general public.
