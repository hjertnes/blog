I have always had a pen or a pencil in my pocket, or at least for as
long as I can remember.

1.  Pilot G2
2.  Retro 51
3.  Pilot Metropolitan
4.  TWSBI Eco
5.  Pencils
6.  Fisher Spacepen.

Let me preface this with what I have concluded with being a good pocket
pen, and this is not the same as a "mini pen". A lot of people prefer a
smaller pen as their pocket pen. I'm not one of them. Because my pants
have larger pockets.

-   It should have a cap, because retractable pens often get a lot of shit
    inside it, that can cause some mess like it soaking up a lot of ink.
    And sometimes you twist / click the mechanism that can destroy pants.
-   It should be low maintenance. We all have many writing instruments
    that require a lot of up keep, like fountain pens or pencils. The
    thing I have in my pocket should be something that always works
-   The cap should be tight enough for you to trust that it won't come off
-   THe construction should be solid enough so that you don't feel it will
    break.

Of the items on the list above, I personally have only been happy with
the Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen and the Spacepen. None of them are
perfect, but both of them are built in a way where I can trust that they
never spill ink in my pants. The Metropolitan required a little bit too
much up keep (aka too low ink capacity) and the Spacepen refill is not
my favourite. But I might try to replace it with a Retro 51 refill, or
something similar.
