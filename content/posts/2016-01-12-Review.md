The Leuchtturm1917 notebooks are a fantastic alterntaive to everyone that have been using Moleskine, that wants something similar, with better paper quality.

I think you get a lot of notebook for your money when you buy a Leuchtturm1917. The A5 size is around $19 and the A4 size is around $33. That is more or less the same price as similar Moleskine notebooks. It is also more or less the same I pay per page for the refills for my Midori Travelers Notebook.

More or less everything about Leuchtturm1917 notebooks are great. They look fantastic, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. The paper quality is fantastic, and the dry time is pretty good; it is much faster than Rhodia.

I don’t currently use any Leuchtturm1917 notebooks. Long story. But I used two of them as my journal in the first part of 2015. Then I forgot to order new ones, so I found some acceptagble notebooks in a local store here in Bergen, then I had some gift certificates I had to use before they expired, so I got some more.

But, I’m pretty sure I will order a few Leuchtturm1917 notebooks the next time I’m going to buy a A4 notebook. Everything about them is great, but there is at the same time nothing that excites be about them. It isn’t like my Midori Travelers Notebook or my Hobonichi Planner.

I would without doubt go for a Leuchtturm1917 notebook, if you are looking for something similar to the larger than pocket size Moleskine products.
