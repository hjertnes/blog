I put a task called "Write something in the Squarespace web-interface"
in TaskPaper a few days ago, when I realised that I've never actually
written anything here. I usually just write in Byword and copy-page it
into the web-interface.

The experience of doing this might have been a little bit better if I
had tried this a few days ago. Because Squarespace just released a new
version of their block-system today. There are a few things about that I
don't like.

I have to double click to be able to insert text, this used to be a
single click. And secondly, I can't get a fullscreen input field to
write in. I get this pop-over in the fullscreen mode.

First of all, this interface is no worse, and no better than what
WordPress or Tumblr provides from a writing perspective. The block
system is however much better from a layout, and everything else
perspective.

I think I will go back to writing in Byword; I will however check back
later to see if they make any changes to make this a better experience.

One final note. It seems like I can't run the spelling control in this
input field. **Big minus**.
