CleanMyMac 3 is out. There are a lot of terrible "cleaning" utilities
out there. CleanMyMac is the only good one I have found. I have used
version 1, and are using version 2, and I will be upgrading to version 3
in a few days.

They have added some maintainance features, like permission repair, and
extended the stuff they can clean.

CMM is a must for anyone with a small SSD. The price is $39.99, with %50
discount this week, and a permanent %50 off upgrade price.

Go and get it!
