The new version of Reeder for OS X just reached public beta. And it's
_great_. It lacks a few features that I really need. Like Instapaper.
But that's not big deal -- for now.

But for me, the big question is -- will I buy it? I have been using
ReadKit for about a year now. And I love it.

I'll guess the big question for both me and a lot of other RSS power
users are: what will Reeder for OS X give us? I hope for a really hard
competition between the two in the coming months. And I hope for some
amazing features in both apps.
