I have set up my own Micropub server, in order to be able to post from
the Micro.blog apps to a Hugo site. It isn't very difficult to do, but
the challenge was to find a overview of how to do it.

Let's begin with the backend endpoints. The minimum is a micropub
end-point, a media end-point and a "configuration" end-point.

I have set up mine to look as follows:

-   domain/micropub (POST) -- Micropub

-   domain/media (POST) -- Media

-   domain/ (GET) - CONFIG

When you log in with the Micro.blog apps, it will ask the configuration
end-point to figure out where to post images. In other words: you have
to log in and out if you change it. Then it will first post the image to
the media end points, that hands back a URL to the file you uploaded,
and it uses that to post that to the micropub endpoint.

1.  Write the end-points to follow the MicroPub specification

2.  Hook up all the correct meta tags.

3.  Hook up [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com)

4.  Start posting.

I have made a implementation of the micropub server, and some
[information](https://github.com/hjertnes/micropub) about how to look
it up.
