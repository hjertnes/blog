The long awaited update for
[Mars Edit 4](https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) finally came,
back in November. I write this a few weeks after it, but you will
probably not see this before a while after that because of scheduling of
posts and so on. Here is the secret of having a blog that posts a post
every X days; you write them in advance and schedule them.

So, MarsEdit. It is one of those classic Mac apps that every one I knew
and looked up to had installed when I got my first Mac. Funny thing, the
reason I bought my first Mac was this awesome little app called
TextMate.

MarsEdit is an awesome app for writing, updating and managing content on
your blog. If it has an API it's probably supported. I had fallen out of
the habit of using the old version, because it felt very dated, but the
new version is awesome. And I open it more or less daily. I post most of
my stuff directly from Emacs, but I almost always use MarsEdit, when I
need to edit, remove or reference an existing blog post.

Awesome app, and it's made by a indie developer that really care about
the Mac as a platform. Can't recommend it enough.
