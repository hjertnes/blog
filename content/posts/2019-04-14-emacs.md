The first thing I did was to disable eshint and standard.

Then make sure you have a .eslintrc or .eslintrc.js file in your repo;
one of them is sufficient.

The next step is to install eslint and all your plugins, configs etc
globally (yarn global add or npm i -g). There are ways to get it to work
with per project installs, but this is way easier.

Then make sure eslint works. just run eslint --print-config . until it
prints the config. Then run M-x flycheck-validate-setup (double check
this command) and make sure it work, and restart emacs. And that should
be it.
