I have been looking for a good desk pencil sharpener since I realized
that pencils are awesome. My impression very early on was that the
Classroom Friendly was one of the great ones. So I decided to get one,
but did not do anything about it because I could not order one through
any of the regular channels because they don't want to ship outside the
US. So, I started to look for other alternatives. And considered a
handful of them. But decided to get the Classroom Friendly instead;
through ebay. It was as painless as I could hope it to be. Even though
the shipping took over twice as long as it would have taken through any
of my regular shops.

Now, let's get on to the sharpener. It is amazing. It feels like a
quality product out of another era. Like when build quality was
important, instead of cheap crap that seems to be the standard these
days.

It is a joy to use, gives me a perfect point every single time. And it
takes no time to sharpen a fresh pencil.

The only ting I have to say about it is that it leaves some nasty marks
on the pencil. It doesn't bother me that much, but I guess it might
bother some of the more obsessive out there.
