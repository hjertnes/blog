I currently use three different text editors. My main one is Emacs. This
is where I work when I write new code or spend a larger amount of time
in one single file. While I use Visual Studio Code when I have to jump
between files a lot. And my go to tool when I just need to go into a
file fixing a few minor things is VIM.

I'm going to get rid of VS Code when I change jobs. Because 99% of what
I use VS Code for is related to work stuff.

This is not a VIM vs Emacs discussion, both of them are more or less the
same kind of thing when you enable a lot of third party code in them,
and my Emacs setup is very much a "full featured" one, while my VIM
setup is very minimal. That is on purpose to make sure that I can get in
and out of VIM faster than it would take me to launch Emacs or VS Code
(or VIM itself if I set it up to have the same kind of features my Emacs
setup has).
