> My point here isn't "Siri is better than Google Voice Search", or even
> "Siri is as good as Google Voice Search". Once you get past the
> superficial level, they're different enough that it's hard to make a
> blanket one-is-better-than-the-other comparison. I'd even agree that
> Google Voice Search is better at many complex queries, and, further,
> that "What's the temperature?" is a very simple question.
