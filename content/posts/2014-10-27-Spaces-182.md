Spaces was my favourite feature introduced in OS X 10.5 Leopard. This is
a feature that you will find in most Window Managers and Desktop
Environments, if not all for X Windows. In other words: all old Linux
and Unix users know what they are.

The problem with Spaces, Workspaces or whatever you call them is not
power users. The problem is make it understandable and approachable for
regular users.

The version that shipped with 10.5, was more or less the same as what I
had in Linux many years before, then Apple started to really improve on
the idea with 10.7. But I think it is now, with 10.10 that they finally
cracked it.

The big change is of course to combine Maximise and Full Screen, in the
same green button. It makes the whole idea of spaces more approachable
for most people. Not because it is better, or anything; it isn't. But it
makes it impossible for any OS X user to avoid it.

Spaces and full screen apps is powerful features; but they shouldn't be
considered power user features; they should be something everyone uses.

I hope 2014 will be the year people finally started to use them. They
are one of the best ways be more productive on a smaller screen. It's
not as good as having a larger screen, or multiple screens; but it is
almost as good.
