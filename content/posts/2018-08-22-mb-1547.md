As a user of Micro.blog you have a few options to how you read your
timeline and post content or replies.

I'm not that worlds best at using so called social apps. The fact is
that I forget about them when I have more interesting stuff to do. And
the next thing I know is that there have gone hours or even days between
looking at them. This is why I almost never read anything in the
Micro.blog apps.

What I do is that I read my timeline as a RSS feed, and I re-locate the
post in the Micro.blog app if I would like to reply to it.

This works much better for me, because then I can read all the times at
a speed that works for me. I started doing this back before the
Micro.blog apps supported to go far back in time, and most of the M.B
action happened while I was asleep.

Using RSS for this is probably not something most people would want to
do. But I love it.
