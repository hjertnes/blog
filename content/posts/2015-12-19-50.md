I posted some pictures of my collection(on my [personal site](http://hjertnes.me/2015/06/18/32-used-field-notes-.html)) of used Field Notes back in June; when the number was 32. And I realised yesterday when I finished another one that I now have used 50 of them. So I decided to do the same thing this time as well.

There have been times where I have used a notebook for six months, and there are times where it only lasted two days. But the usual life time is more like 7-10 days.
