I've been testing out the new "Sensei" driven auto-tune function in
Lightroom CC for the last hour or so, and I got to say it's pretty damn
great.

The auto-tuning feature of Lightroom have been a lot of "swing and a
miss" over the years. When I started to use Lightroom in 2013 I thought
it was usually making my pictures worse. Then a year later it got a lot
better. It didn't always improve the pictures, but some times it did.

This new machine learning driven approach seems to be working great. All
the pictures I have tested it on this far looks better, than they did.
Not always by a lot, but still better.
