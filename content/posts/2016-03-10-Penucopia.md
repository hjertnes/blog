  The word geek has traditionally had more of a negative connotation, but has been used more recently to mean someone who is passionate about a subject. Indeed, I can definitely say that I “geek out” about fountain pens and stationery. I “geek out” about mechanical keyboards too. But there are a wide array of topics that I also geek out about. To me, it’s about caring about something deeply. I want to ensure that when I get something, it’s the best product that I can get that meets my needs.

Fantastic post. The funny thing about being a geek is that almost everyone are geeks about at least a few things. Being a geek is to care much more about a certain thing than most people do. And the interesting thing about being a geek is that the combination of areas where you are a geek is very personal.
