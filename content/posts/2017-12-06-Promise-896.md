I have talked a lot about promises before. Some people think they are a
unnesseary complcation of simple callbacks. I disagree, because async
await makes it possible to make code a lot more readable, especially if
you need to do a lot of stuff that would have callbacks. But I have not
talked that much about two methods that live in the Promsie prototype:
all and race.

Promise.all is a method you can use to resolve any number of promises,
and it will not resolve until all of them are resolved. The result is a
iterable of the result from all of the promises, in the order they were
in the array to passed to Promise.all.

Promise.race on the other hand also takes an array, but will resolve
when the _first_ promise resolves. Useful if you for example have
multiple ways to fetch some kind of data, and you just want the any of
them.
