I have been moving stuff away from google for a very long time. It all
started when I got fed up with Google Docs and Gmail. And it looks like
2015 was the year when geeks started to move away from Google Search.

There are reasons to use Google, and there are reasons to not use
Google.

Ads are a part of the internet, and I don't expect to get away from them
ever, but I try to limit how much each company know about me. This
means: I use Google only where they are the best, or don't have any
close competitors.

I do the same with Facebook; I only use it when I have to.
