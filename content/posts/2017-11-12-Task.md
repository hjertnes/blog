One of the most important, if not the most important part of a well functioning system for managing the things you have to do is a ever changing system to manage it all.

The system I was happy with in 2010 or in 2012 or 2015 is not the same as what I am happy with today.

While I don’t currently use pen and paper to mange everything (at the moment) I still use it for a few very crucial tasks. I still use my beloved Leuchtturm1917 dot grid notebook in the planning stage, or when I do a brain dump. And I still use it to map out the most important stuff I need to get done day per day per week.
