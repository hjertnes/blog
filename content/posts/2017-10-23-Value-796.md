In my previous post about the .forEach method I said that you can mutate
the values of the entities of the array you are running it on. This is
only kind of true. You will be able to mutate reference types but not
value types. A reference type is: functions, objects and arrays. Values
types are: numbers, strings bool etc. The difference is that, when you
pass a object to a function you can actually mutate the object, while a
number would be passed as a value, and not be mutated. Look at the two
examples below: By reference:
