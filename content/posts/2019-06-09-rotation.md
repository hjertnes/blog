For some reason I just went a little bit nuts and inked up all the pens I love using last weekend. I'm not carrying all of them all the time, usually just two. But my plan is to rotate between them. All of them have different things I like about them

-   YStudio portable fountain pen
-   Lamy 2000
-   TWSBI Eco Broad nib
-   TWSBI Eco Stub nib
-   Pilot Vanishing Point
-   Pilot Metal Falcon

I'm not sure how long it will last. But I'm writing more with pens that I have in a long time at the moment. When I got into Pencils last year my fountain pen use went way down. But I think things are back to something more balanced now.
