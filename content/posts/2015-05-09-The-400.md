I don't get the clean desk thing. Mine is always a mess. I have a very
long desk, and it is a mess. With an empty hole in the middle -- this is
where I work.

Mostly writing in my Hobonichi Planner, a Field Notes, a regular
notebook or on my MacBook Air.

I don't need a tidy or well designed desk to work, I just need a flat
surface large enough to fix a few books, a notebook and some kind of
computer.

Does this mean I never clean my desk? No. I usually do it either once a
week or when I'm done with a project.
