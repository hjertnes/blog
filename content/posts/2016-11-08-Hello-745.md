This could be viewed as a remake of the technology focused site I had in various forms from 2009 until early this year when I deleted it, and that site was an extension of the many different blogs and sites I had since I started doing web development in my early teens.

I looked at various places to start a blog, but I decided to go for a simple staticky generated web page, powered by a simple Swift Console Application I wrote yesterday. It is very bare bones at the moment, and I plan to work on it and maybe open source it at some point.
