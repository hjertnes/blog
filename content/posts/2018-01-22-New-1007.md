I started a daily [JavaScript](https://jstips.blog) focused blog in
November. Single topic blog posts, sometimes larger series of blog posts
if the subject matter is big. Monday through Friday.

And I have also started to hang out over at
[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). You can find me at
<https://micro.blog/hjertnes> or
[Hjertnes.social](https://hjertnes.blog) or think Twitter, but driven
by blogs and rss; with some nice Magic by Manton Reece to make it
function more like a social network.
