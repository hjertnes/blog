MacStories have a review of Alternote; my favorite way to use Evernote
for notes.

Evernote is great, and you can use it for a lot of different things, I
mostly use it to manage files, shared notes and archived projects and
files. But Alternote makes Evernote a good option to Dropbox + nvALT on
the Mac, and I would consider switching to it, if there was an iOS app.

Check out the review!
