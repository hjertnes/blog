I can't wait until I get the chance of using this
[one](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator). In
functional programming languages like F# it is common to do things like
"64 |> sqrt" instead of "sqrt(64)". The value of it might not be as
clear with the simple example I gave above.

But it can make more complicated chains of function calls much easier to
understand and maintain because of how composable the syntax is. And not
more silly syntax errors because you forgot to add or remove some
opening or closing parentheses.
