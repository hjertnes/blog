One of the problems with digital photography is that it is so easy to
end up with 30 000 pictures shot over 4 four years; and that is after
you have deleted a lot of them. I have spent a lot of time the last 8
months or so trying to get rid of as much of the "noise" in that
collection as possible. It will probably take a while before I get
there. You get rid of 75%, then you give it some time, and repeat it
until you can't remove anything more without loosing something you
really care about.

Some people think that machine learning or what ever will solve this
problem. It might, for some or to some degree. But I still think we have
to do the manual work of deciding what to keep or not. It requires a lot
of work, like everything else worth doing.
