PDFPen 7 is out. A great update to my favorite PDF app. I have been
using it since I discovered it on Mac Power Users back in the day. The
great thing about PDFPen is that you can buy a fully featured PDF app,
even though you only need it a few times a year.

It won't cost you a fortune, something I can't say, for Adobe's PDF
apps.

Great app, check it out!
