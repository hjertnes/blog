I was looking into how to do something really simple using Drafts and
Todoist on Saturday.

The basic idea was that I wanted an easy way to either add or create a
new project and then add a series of tasks to it. (First line is the
project, and the rest is tasks).

Well. I thought, this is a perfect opportunity to play around with
Workflow. So, I made the damn thing and then I also did it using
Pythonista.

The verdict? It took way shorter time using Pythonista because I know
how it works, but I think something like Workflow is the right tool, if
you don't know how to code.

This is a common thing I often see myself doing. When something is very
simple, I almost always end up writing it myself, because then I don't
need to learn all the "jargon" and metaphysics every single system
always have.

The difficult thing is to know when to write it yourself, and when to
learn what is already there.
