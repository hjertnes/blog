This piece by Patrick Rhone is fantastic.

I get annoyed when people use "introverted" instead of "being for
myself" in a sentence. For example "I have been very introverted the
last few days".

I'm a introvery, but I don't have a problem talking in front of large
amounts of people, or to do jobs that most people think about as
"extroverted-jobs" like street or door to door sales. There are
different versions of introverts, and extraverts.

The difference is not in how loud or quite they are; the difference is
in how they re-charge. I re-charge by being alone, by myself, while an
extrovert do the same by beign around other people
