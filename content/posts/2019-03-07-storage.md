I have three backup systems, one in the cloud, one clone and one
incremental backup.

The basics is that I use Arq to back up to Backblaze B2, and I use Time
Machine to backup to an external drive, plus that I clone my system and
the combined "archive" and Time Machine drive. Everything from old
stuff, to time machine data and my Plex library live on that drive.

I recently changed all the drives. This is something I do every third
year or so. When one of the drives starts to act up, I order new ones as
fast as possible.

This time I went for two 5TB drives for the archive and as always a
500GB drive for cloning my system.

The reason I do this is that good NAS or external RAID systems are too
expensive. When I compared the last time, the price of getting a future
proof RAID, would basically be the same as one and half round of drives
of my current system, before I started to buy drives.

The reality is that drives with built in USB interfaces have become so
cheap, that I don't see it ever making sense from a pure money
perspective.

The thing that migh get me to do it however is the fact that the time it
takes to clone a 5TB drive (it will probably be closer to 10TB the next
time) is so long that I'm soon at a point where I kind of have to move
to a raid.
