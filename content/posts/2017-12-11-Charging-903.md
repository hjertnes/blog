It takes forever to charge the iPhone 8 Plus using the charger and cable
you got with the phone; and it is a little bit better if you use a iPad
charger. But it still takes a very long time.

But, you can get faster charging if you take one of the Apple MacBook
Pro USB C bricks and plug one of the LIghtning to USB-C cables into it.
My impression is that it charges around twice the speed.

Which brings me to my point. Why can't Apple start to bundle better
chargers with their devices? Or at least a cheap version of their
current chargers with USB-C instead of USB-A. To charge using the USB-A
cables is horrible. It takes forever. It is bad user experience to wait
longer.

I get the margins argument, that people use every time someone thinks
Apple should do better. And, yes, I get that. But I just want Apple to
start moving in the right direction. Because if Apple comes out with
phones with bigger and bigger batteries, the charging over USB-A thing
will become a joke.

If you want faster charging: get a MacBook Pro power brick (the 13 inch
version is good enough) and a Lightning to USB-C cable.
