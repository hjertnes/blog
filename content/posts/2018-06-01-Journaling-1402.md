I have been a Day One user for a very long time, I think I first
downloaded it in the early days of the Mac App Store. And it is a great
app. Pretty, well designed, focused and they are willing to try new
stuff. Also they seem to be very open to people like Brett Terpstra to
write tools that feed data into it. And it is very easy to get data in
and out.

What I have done is to move all my journaling that isn't focused around
photos to org-journal. In order to try to journal more frequently. And
having it accessible with just one M-x command in Emacs seemed to do the
trick. But I'm still going to use DayOne for some stuff. Like photos. I
take a picture of myself most days and add it to DayOne.
