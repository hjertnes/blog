All the previews are generated in the cloud, or I do at least think they
are. Which means that it may take more or less time before you can
process your images after a import; it all depends on the speed of your
internet connection.

For me, it took way less time when I imported two 64GB cards yesterday.
But I have a very fast 120mbit connection.
