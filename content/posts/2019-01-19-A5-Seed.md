This notebook cover have been on top of my list for a while, but when I
got into Bullet Journaling at the end of the year, I decided to finally
get one. Long story short, this cover will replace my Hightower. The
reason I was so exited about is that it makes it a lot easier when I
just want to bring my Bullet Journal somewhere and do some stuff.
Instead of many it is just one.

The Seed comes in a A6 and A5 version, I got the A5 version to use with
my A5 Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal. It is a cover, with a zipper, one
pocket on the outside where I keep some spare Field Notes and my
passport. And on the inside you have two pen loops, and a pocket for
anything business card sized. Plus two pockets made to slide your
notebook into. I have some of the slim Nock Index Cards, my Lamy 2000
and my Vanishing Point in it.

It is great. I love how easier it is to do some Bullet Journaling with
it. There is just a lot less stuff I have to bring or take out of my
bag. It's all there. Two notes, the inner most pen kind of have to be
out of it's pocket to be comfortable to write. And you can't have a lot
of Index Cards when you start to get close to the end of your notebook.

Other than that a awesome notebook.
