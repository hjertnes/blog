A little bit of history. The Pilot G2 0.7 was the pen that got me into
better pens. And when that happened I soon figured out two things: I
don't like scratchy, and I like a thick solid line much better than a
thin one. And I never questioned this much as I moved into fountain
pens. And I still like thicker lines better than thin ones. I still like
wet pens better than dry ones. And I still like a not scratchy nib
better than a scratchy.

I have a Kaweco pen with a medium nib that feels a lot finer than most
of the medium nibs I have used before.

Let me be perfectly clear, it is not what I prefer, but it is not bad.
And there are some stuff I like about it. For example how I have a lot
more control over my writing because a finer nib will naturally be more
scratchy.

I might get more pens with a finer nib in the future, or I might not.
