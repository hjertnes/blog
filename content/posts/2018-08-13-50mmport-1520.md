Apple does this with their dual lens phones, and Fujifilm does this with
their "tele" converter lens for their x100 series of cameras. And it is
just wrong.

No one would consider a 50mm on a full frame camera to be a telephoto or
a portrait lens. It is a fucking normal lens, and the most normal of
them. According to Wikipedia a telephoto lens starts at 67mm.

Why is this important? Because it is kind of annoying that they call it
for something it is not. The other side of it is that you usually want
to use a longer lens when you take portraits because the longer the lens
is the more proportional "stuff looks". If you shoot with something less
than 50mm it is very easy to get a nose that looks huge etc.

A very popular portrait focal length is the 85mm or 135mm. The longer
the better, except that when who you take pictures of are too far away
it becomes a little bit difficult to talk to them.
