I just wrote about
[Serial](http://hjertnes.me/2014/11/23/serial.html). They are the
fastest podcast to reach 5 million download, according to
[The
Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/18/serial-podcast-itunes-apple-downloads-streams).

I was met with a "please donate" pop up, when I went to their website
last night. It's clear that there are some shows where ads alone might
not be sustainable. Too limited audience or large production cost are
two possible reasons for it.

I don't mind ads on podcasts, most of them are good. But I think a
combination of ads and listener support is the only sustainable way
going forward. Unless we don't want any experimental or only shows with
huge audiences.

Even [5by5](http://5by5.tv/donate) are doing it. I think things like
[Patreon](http://www.patreon.com) is great.

I have no idea where this will end, but I hope it is a place where
podcasts are funded with a combination of ads and listener support.
