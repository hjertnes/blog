HTC have been a sinking ship for a while now, and I feel bad for them.
They used to be one of the big players, and they have always made
different and interesting phones. My first Android Phone was the HTC
Hero, and they are still one of the few companies I would consider if I
was looking for an Android device. I hope they survive, but I'm not
optimistic.
