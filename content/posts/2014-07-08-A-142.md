I just watched "The Internet's own boy", and he truly was that. Aron
created RSS. Aron created Reddit. And he was fighting for a lot of the
stuff that I have been fighting for in my own country for a long time.
Both in terms of internet and environment. And as a Greenpeace employee,
civil disobedience is the thing I believe in.

There are a reason behind this. I didn't write the day Steve died. And I
didn't write the day Aron died.

But I'm writing this today. I have cried three times since I was a
teenager. It was the day Steve died, it was the day Aron died, and when
my grandmother died last year.

Aron was fighting for the internet we all want. Watch the movie. Spread
the word, and continue the fight.

Civil disobedience is important. It's the key, and it's the solution, in
the end.
