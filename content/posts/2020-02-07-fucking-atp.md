I don't listen to any tech podcasts anymore, because they bore me to death. The closest is probably Go time, a podcast about the Go Programming Language. But @eli talked about how dumb the hosts were being so I decided to listen and post my reactions to it.

-   Oh my fucking god. So much talk about all kinds of bullshit...
-   SwiftUI
-   Who the fuck writes a view that is hundred or hundreds of lines.
    -   Clean code and Single Responsibility FTW
-   Weird stuff is hard with declarative models because declarative programming tries to force you to not doing weird stuff, and weird stuff is almost always a bad idea.
-   Declarative programming is hard, but not impossible.
-   There is plenty of good examples of good patterns to follow if you look at for example react.
-   Even though three gumpy old rich white men don't think so, there are clean ways to use it
-   I think John is the only one who gets it
-   Marco struggles with anything new, as always. He'll like a cobol programmer
-   Homebrew
-   Marco is all wrong.
-   Homebrew works well most of the time, and things rarely break as long as you keep things up to date. It might be broken for a few days here and there. But I almost never experience it, and I upgrade my system multiple times a week.
-   John builds from source, and that is the most John thing ever.
