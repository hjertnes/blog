Marco is another DuckDuckGo convert. It seems like 2015 is the year when
a lot of people move away from Google as their search engine.

DuckDuckGo is more or less as good as Google. And everyone that are
uneasy about Google should switch.

I'm so glad that Apple finally added support for the search engine in
Safari on both iOS and OS X last year.
