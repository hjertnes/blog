I used to use Reeder 1, in my Google Reader days. Then I moved on to
ReadKit, when I moved over to FeedWrangler. And I have been using it
since then. My reasons for not buying Reeder 2 is simple: I don't like
the design, and ReadKit looks better; and the performance difference
between Reeder and ReadKit isn't a big deal for me.

A OS X version of Unread would be interesting.
