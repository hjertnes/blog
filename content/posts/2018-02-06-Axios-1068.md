[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a awesome HTTP Client for
JavaScript that I have used for over two years now. I first discovered
it when I was looking for a good and clean Promise based HTTP Client
that did just that -- HTTP stuff.

Back in the day most of us used jQuery for almost everything. These days
I try to avoid adding it to my React based projects.

Axios is very easy to use. You just import it and call
axios.get/post/put/delete and you have more advanced options if you need
them. I have yet to find something I had to do that can't be done with
axis.
