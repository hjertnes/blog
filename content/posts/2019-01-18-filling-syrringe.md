I have written about this before, but I'm going to do it again, because
I think this is awesome.

If you have a pen that takes cartridges, you are often limited the the
kind of ink you can use, unless you get a converter.

A converter is not without problems, because they often have a little
bit limited capacity, at least in reality, because you can't fill it all
the way.

One way to solve this, either by re-using ink cartridges or by using a
converter is by syrringe filling.

This is how I fill all my non piston pens.

I take out the cartridge or converter, then I just fill it with ink with
a syrringe and stick it into the pen.

This means that you can fill it all the way up. It is not messy and
super quick.

Getting syrringes from Goulet was the smartest thing I ever did. If
you're unhappy with how much ink you get into your converter you should
get one.
