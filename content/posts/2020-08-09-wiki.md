I have been working on some changes on my wiki this weekend:

-   Some mayor changes in the structure; there will be more soon ish.
-   Moved back to using hugo and ox-hugo to generate it. I'm really happy with the result. I think a lot of what I loved about the former format have been maintained, while not all the issues I had with the first attempt at building a wiki with ox-hugo.
