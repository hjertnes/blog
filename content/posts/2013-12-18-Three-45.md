I finally found a functional limit on apps, on my iPhone. I've had a
really hard time to figure out what kind of limit I should impose on
myself after I gave up on the horrible broken folders in iOS 7. I have
been both a 1 page, 2 page, 3 page and a whole lot of pages person
through the years.

All the default apps from Apple fill up a little bit more than a page
and a half.

So I needed to have at least two pages.

I went through everything. I deleted all the "kind of useful but I never
use them"-apps. And I ended up with three full pages of apps. There is
not a single third party app on my phone that don't serve a real
purpose.

The apps that is left, is all of the apps I really need. All the apps I
really use. And I don't mean the apps I use once a month. This is the
apps I use at least once a week.

This is the list.

**1Password** is my password manager of choice. I use it to store
password, software licenses and all kinds of other information that I
need to keep secure. Great app for close to every platform.

**Podwrangler** is my go to podcasting app for the moment. I'm just using
it until Marco's overcast is out. Then I'll mark a choice for what. I'm
going yo use as my go to client for the coming months.

**Audible** is a great app service and store for audiobooks. You can look
at it as the App Store or Kindle for audiobooks.

**Notesy** the icon looks like shit, and the app used to be kind of ugly.
But it got a nice update after iOS 7. It is the most stable and only
markdown + Dropbox text editor for iOS that just works no matter what.
I've had 2000 notes, and I've had huge single notes. It always works.
And that is the single most important thing for me.

**Quotebook** is a great app for iOS that let you store, manage and share
notes you find.

**Byword** is my primary writing app. I write everything that isn't a note
or over 1500 words in it. On my Mac, iPhone and iPad.

**Evernote** is my everything bucket. I use it as an archive of everything
that is more than just text. I also use it to capture images and
location data.

**Pomodoro** is my Pomodoro app. Its simple. It's fast. And it is one of
the few that is doing just one thing. The Pomodoro part.

**Ember** is a new and powerful image management app, for iOS and OS X. I
use it to store cool images I find. Or shoot with my phone. I store all
the images I want to save that I haven't shot with my DSLR in Ember.

**Day One** is my journaling app. I transcribe all of my paper journal
entries into it. And also all of my paper notes. I add important life
decisions and happenings there. And sometimes I do silly projects like
taking daily pictures of myself.

Goos tagging support makes it easy to store all kinds of different data.
And markdown makes the whole app very powerful. They have apps for both
iOS and OS X.

**Kik** is a simple mobile messaging app I use with friends that isn't on
Facebook,Twitter or iMessage. It's pretty decent. It is funny how no one
have made a messaging app that blows everyone out of the park.

**Tweetbot** the best twitter client out there. It's just amazing.

**OmniFocus 2** the most powerful and probably the best GTD app out there
for power users.

**Fantastical 2** is my favourite calendar app. It gives me everything I
need, and also the only interface for adding events that I like.

**Left to spend** money management for minimalist. I just tell it how much
I can spend per day, and it keeps track of it. And I add all the money I
spend.

It's the only app that is simple enough,for me to actually keeping it up
after quite a few years.

**Newsstand**. I have two magazines in there. The Loop Magazine and The
Magazine. They are amazing.you should check them out if you like reading
really good and interesting articles.

**Facebook Messenger** is the Facebook chat client for iPhone. It's pretty
good. It makes it fast, easy and simple to chat with my friends that
don't use twitter.

**Text Expander Touch** makes sure that all of my typo fixes and boiler
plate text shortcuts from OS X also are there when I write on iOS.

**Snapchat**. Some of my friends use it. I also do that sometimes. But
this is one of the apps that I would remove if it's spot was needed by
some important app.

**Squarespace blog** lets me publish blog posts to this site from my iPad
and iPhone.

**Instapaper** is my preferred read it later service. I mainly transfer
the content to my kindle, but the app is great to have when I don't have
it available.

**Data usage** is a simple and pretty good app for keeping track of how
much cellular data you are using.
