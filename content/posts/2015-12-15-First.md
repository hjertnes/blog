I think it is amazing that a package from California can find its way to Bergen, Norway with FedEx in little over a weekend. The funny or not so funny thing is that I can’t even get a package from our capital to here in the same amount of time.

There are a lot of great stuff here. Let’s begin with the boring stuff. I always throw in a three pack of Field Notes when I order something from a place that carry them. I fill out one every 7 – 10 days, and having too many have never been a problem. I also got a new converter for my Pilot Metropolitan, it works just like the one I had before it(before it broke).

I got a new ink: Pilot Iroshizuku Take-sumi. Because I ran out of my Noodler’s Bernanke Black a few weeks ago. The first thing I did was to clean my pens and filled both of them, plus my new pen with this ink. And I love it. The dry time is longer than the Noodlers, but it is more or less the same as the my “backup” ink, Lamy black. I love it, both the standard Lamy ink and the Noodler’s was kind of black, this is black.

My first expensive fountain pen I bought was the Lamy 2000 I got almost a year ago. I have been looking into another good, but not as expensive fountain pen during the last six months. And I finally pulled the trigger and ordered a TWISBI 580 AL Crystal. I wanted the blue, but it was sold out. So I got the regular silver model instead. The pen is very good, it holds a lot of ink, the nib is smooth, and I love how it looks. My only complaint is that the grip is a little bit slippery.

I have been drooling over the Midori Travelers Notebook since August. And I have been very close to ordering it many times during the last 2-3 years. And I finally did it. The reason is simple: I wanted something in between the large A4 notebooks I write long hand(journaling, and studying) when I am at home and my Field Notes; for example when writing in a coffee shop or traveling. And I also like the idea of buying cheap refills instead of expensive similar notebooks.

I pimped it up with a pen holder, and extra bands so I could fit three refills in it.

My first impressions are: the dry time is shorter than I expected, and it looks great. And I really love the “what the heck is that”-look of the MTN. I would have preferred the lined refill to have a little bit taller lines. But other than that, a fantastic notebook.
