I thought when Apple released it, and I still think that the new MacBook
is a "iPad Pro" for people that want or need OS X or people that need
some kind of like an iPad with a proper keyboard. And I think many
people, especially writers should consider it as their computer, and
those who need more power should consider this as their second computer
instead of an iPad.
