Let's use a simple tabbed interface as an example. Should you hide and
show the different interfaces that represent the different tabs or
should you remove and add them between changes?

You have two different approaches to solving this, you could either hide
and show the content based on which tab is open, or you could remove the
old tab when the user opens the previous one.

There are pros and cons to each one.

The good thing about the show and hide version is that it is really fast
to switch between the two, but the bad thing is that it requires more
time to load the first time and the browser could use a significant
amount of memory of you have a lot of tabs.

The good thing about the add and remove approach is that you use a
minimum of resources and you load fast. The bad thing is that it takes
more time to switch between tabs, and you need to take into
consideration to ask users if they want to save, if they are trying to
switch tab in a dirty state.
