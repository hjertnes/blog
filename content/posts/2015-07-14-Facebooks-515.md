Yes!

I have not had Flash installed outside the bundled version in Chrome
since 2010; when I switched from Firefox to Chrome. And it isn't that
often I need flash for anything; maybe three or four times a month.

We need to phase it out. Because, the remianing flash content will only
dissapair when they are forced to do so.
