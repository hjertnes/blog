I have all kinds of different ways to brew coffee at home. I have a
mocha pot, two Aeropress, more French presses than I can count(people
keep giving them to me for Christmas for some strange reason) and a V60.

My preferred ways these days is to use the V60 because of how easy it is
to use and clean. And I prefer the Mocha pot if I want something like an
espresso. The Aeropress is awesome, but it is too much work to use it
for it to be a regular thing. But I did use it as my preferred brewing
method for years.

I'm not a French press fan though. The coffee is too dirty for my taste.
And the last cups always end up being overbrewed.
