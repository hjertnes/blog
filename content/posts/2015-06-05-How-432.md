I don't post that much about the Apple Watch, because I don't want one,
and I don't care that much, but this is cool. The link bracelet for
Apple Watch is one of the things I want, because of how easy it is to
customize it. To customize most link bracelets on regular watches
inclues using a paperclip to push out pins, and it is a real hazzle.
This is a example of where Apple is the best when it comes to innovation
and improving on something everyone in an industry have been doing wrong
for a long time.
