I'm still on my first Apple Watch: the series 1.

It's slow, but still great.

My plan is to upgrade when the next version comes out, if it survives
that long. And to get a Series 3 if not. The reason I say survive is
that my current one have a crack in the screen.

I do not recommend people to buy an Apple Watch unless you are the kind
of person where Achievements and Push Notifications about moving more
helps to motivate you. And the push notification stuff is okay. But
health related stuff is the only real reason to get an Apple Watch.
