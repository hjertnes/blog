What a month, first Phil Schiller on a live episode of The Talk Show,
and now President Obama on WTF.

This episode is fantastic. He is not a perfect president, but I like
him, and this episode, and the fact that he did it at all makes me feel
good about defending him countless times during his Presidency.

Listen to it, if you are interested in one of the most candid inteviews
with a President I have ever heard.
