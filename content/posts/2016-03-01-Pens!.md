  I was really very pleasantly surprised by the Whitelines pocket notebook. The cover is strong, the design is tasteful and the paper is great.

I love Whitelines notebooks, I used to use them a lot during my first year at the University. They are utilitarian, well designed and have pretty good paper. Their design is fantastic, but that doesnâ€™t mean it is the most beautiful notebook in the world. But it means that they have a very functional design. The thing I loved about them is that lines and grids are designed in a way where it is very easy to ignore them, and follow them when you need to.
