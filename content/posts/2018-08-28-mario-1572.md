This is the first 3D Mario game I have played moer than a little bit.
But I did play a ridicolus amount of the first Mario game growing up.

This game is a very good first game to get for the Switch. It is a open
world game, but not 100% open like Zelda. It is a lot of fun, difficult,
but not too difficult.

And you can continue playing it for a really long time if you're into
it. Because you can continue playing it after you beat Trump, ehh I mean
Bowser.
