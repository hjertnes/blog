I have this cloth bag that I put all the “stuff” I need on a daily basis. Everything from adapters, to cables and so on. There is nothing spacial about the bag itself, I think its the one I got with my H7 headphones. The goal of the bag is that I have everything I need in it, so that I don’t have to thing about it more than necessary(re-charging batteries, and replacing stuff as needed).

I’m pretty happy with everything as of now. The only thing I want to change is the Satechi thing, I want to replace it with a single purpose USB-C to HDMI adapter. Other than that, happy as a clam.

And I do of course have a Apple USB-C Power bricks more or less everywhere; one in my bag, one at my desk at home, one at my desk at work and one at my new house.
