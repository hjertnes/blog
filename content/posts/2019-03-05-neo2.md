I have a Alpha Smart Neo2, it is a digital typewriter. A pretty damn
great one. It is basically just a keyboard, with a small screen and some
memory in it.

It lets me write, without having a full computer. I personally think it
is a hell of a lot better than an iPad, if you just want to type words.

Most of my blog posts either starts out on paper or on this little
thing; and most of those that start out on paper gets transcribe into to
this little bad boy before it get to my computer.

The reason I love it is because it is small, the battery lasts forever,
and I can just have it in the living room. And I don't have the option
of doing anything except writing. The way I use it is that I just write
in the same file, and divide stuff up by adding a markdown style H1
header for each new thing, and once a week I connect it to my mac, open
my Drafts.txt file in Emacs and transfer all my files (usually just the
one) over.
