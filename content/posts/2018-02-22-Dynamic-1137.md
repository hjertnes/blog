Let's say you want to create an object where the key and the value comes
from a parameter. There are a lot of verbose ways to do it. But you can
also do it like this:

<div class="HTML">
  <div></div>

<script src="<https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/94f8f3c40b4401c884e3285e24cc214d.js>"></script>

</div>
