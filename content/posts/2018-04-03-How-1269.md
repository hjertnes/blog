I have used standing desks multiple times in my life. And I think they
are awesome. Mostly because I do in general feel much better if I spend
my day standing and typing instead of just sitting. It does not mean I
stand all the time however. But I can say that, when I'm at the office I
spend more time standing than sitting.

It was really easy to get back into it this time because I had surgery a
while back, and it was more painful to sit than to stand. And when it
was not uncomfortable to sit anymore I was kind of used to standing. So
I just continued.

But the way I have done it in the past have been to add a repeating
reminder to my phone every hour when I usually work reminding me to
stand. And just stand until my feed started to hurt and then sit down.
Then I decreased the interval of the reminders until I could stand for
more or less a whole day without it being uncomfortable.
