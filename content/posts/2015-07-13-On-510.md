This is a unsolvable problem. Many of the Public Beta / Developer Beta
users understand that stuff won't work and that developers can't ship
versions that build against the new OS API's yet. But there are still
many users that don't understand this. It is unfortunate, and as always,
I hope that Apple will do something about the review system.
