The 29th of March was the day I finally did something I should have done
a long time ago.

I deleted my Instagram accounts and my Facebook account.

The only thing I used Facebook for was to chat with a handful of people,
and I just moved those conversations over to other venues like SMS,
Keybase and E-mail.

It will be long go by the time I publish this, and it feels great. To
delete it might not be much, but it is the most drastic thing I can do
to show Facebook that I do not like what they are doing. And it is not
just the recent scandals. Google and Facebook does a lot of the same
stuff. But they seem to be better about not crossing the line and
surprising us as much. And you can use them without having an account.
