When I use a fountain pen I always end up with ink all over the side of
my left hand, and the ink end up being all over my fingers when I refill
any of my pens. Also: when I use a pencil I end up having graphite all
over my hands.

The Ink Smudge is one part a description of how it looks when I use
writing instruments, and one part a metaphor for my writing. I'm a
little bit messy when I use pen and paper, and my writing is also a
little bit messy. Some people write, and edit, and edit and work on
their blog posts until they end with a beautiful piece of art. I just
get an idea, write it and schedule it for publishing. There are times I
have to re-write some of it. But I'm not the kind of person that try to
write something perfect like that.
