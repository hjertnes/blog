I just got some Index Cards from Nock in the mail the other day. This is
the first pack of Index Cards I have bought in years. They have never
been a part of my system for many different reasons. Mainly because I
think books are more practical when you have a very portable setup.
Sometimes I write in the office, other times my home office, or on the
train or using the table in the living room. You get the picture.

But I got a Talluah as a part of the latest PenAddict Kickstarter. So I
figured that I had to find some index cards to fit in it. And of course
Brad had made some from Nock.co. I don't have much to compare it to
except the really think and cheap ones we had at home growing up.

These cards are smaller than the standard. Exactly the same size as a
business card.

It will be a seperate review of the case and how I use these cards
later.

These cards are great, handles pencil and my fountain pens great.
Exacltly what you expect from Nock.co. They are not cheap, but not that
expensive either. $5 for 50 of them. I got four packs of them, and I'll
probably get more of them soon.

I recommend checking out the Nock.co ones if you are looking for some
great cards that work with more or less any kind of pen.
