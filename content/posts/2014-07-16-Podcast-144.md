I'm not sure, if I wrote about podcast networks during
[Marco's](http://marco.org) big podcast network rant a while back. But
I have been thinking about it for the last few hours.

I love podcast networks. I'm not a podcaster, but I listen to a lot of
them. And they are a great a way to find stuff to listen to.

70Decibels was a great example, and 5by5 is a great example. I used to
listen to almost every podcast on 70Decibels, except for that sci-fi
thing.

5by5 is larger. But I think I have checked out almost every active
podcast on the network since 2011. And 5by5 is still the largest source
of podcasts in my podcast client.

Podcast Networks might not be the best thing in the world for
podcasters, but I think they are great for discovering podcasts.
