I was walking around in the city, while Ingri and I were waiting for the
train back home and I walked past one Leuchtturm1917 display case and
two Lamy display cases. And I thought: damn things have changed since

1.

Back when I started, the only fountain pen related thing I knew about in
Norway that was available was Parker. You could get the cartridges,
while pens was something you had to order. And there was Mont Blanc
stuff. But that's stupid money.

In 2018, I could jump on the train, buy a Lamy Safari, Al Star or any of
the entry level Lamy pens or a Leuchtturm1917 notebook. Something I had
to order from UK or US in the past.

This is weird.
