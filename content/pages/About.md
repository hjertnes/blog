# About

I&#8217;m Eivind, and this is my personal web site and blog. You find all of my social media stuff [here][1] and [here][2], they are the same it just depends on if you want to follow me on Micro.blog or subscribe to the site itself. I also have a pen and paper [blog][3] and a JavaScript [blog][4]. Everything else long form will end up on this site.



I live right outside Bergen, Norway with my dogs and fianc√®.



I have worked with it most of my life, except for a two year period when I did street and door to door fundraising. I have a lot of experience doing app development and web development. I prefer Django or .NET Core on the backend or React on the front end. And I have also done app development (iOS and Android) using Java, Objective-C and Swift; but I only enjoy Swift.



My personal interests are analog writing tools, coding, dogs, photography, reading and writing. And I also love playing guitar and taking pictures.
